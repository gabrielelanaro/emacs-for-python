;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Python files with some fontification and
;; indentation bits extracted from original Dave Love's python.el
;; found in GNU/Emacs.

;; While it probably has less features than Dave Love's python.el and
;; PSF's python-mode.el it provides the main stuff you'll need while
;; keeping it simple :)

;; Implements Syntax highlighting, Indentation, Movement, Shell
;; interaction, Shell completion, Shell virtualenv support, Pdb
;; tracking, Symbol completion, Skeletons, FFAP, Code Check, Eldoc,
;; imenu.

;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification of code is provided and supports
;; python's triple quoted strings properly.

;; Indentation: Automatic indentation with indentation cycling is
;; provided, it allows you to navigate different available levels of
;; indentation by hitting <tab> several times.  Also when inserting a
;; colon the `python-indent-electric-colon' command is invoked and
;; causes the current line to be dedented automatically if needed.

;; Movement: `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' functions are
;; properly implemented.  There are also specialized
;; `forward-sentence' and `backward-sentence' replacements
;; (`python-nav-forward-sentence', `python-nav-backward-sentence'
;; respectively).  Extra functions `python-nav-sentence-start' and
;; `python-nav-sentence-end' are included to move to the beginning and
;; to the end of a setence while taking care of multiline definitions.
;; `python-nav-jump-to-defun' is provided and allows jumping to a
;; function or class definition quickly in the current buffer.

;; Shell interaction: is provided and allows you to execute easily any
;; block of code of your current buffer in an inferior Python process.

;; Shell completion: hitting tab will try to complete the current
;; word.  Shell completion is implemented in a manner that if you
;; change the `python-shell-interpreter' to any other (for example
;; IPython) it should be easy to integrate another way to calculate
;; completions.  You just need to specify your custom
;; `python-shell-completion-setup-code' and
;; `python-shell-completion-string-code'.

;; Here is a complete example of the settings you would use for
;; iPython 0.11:

;; (setq
;;  python-shell-interpreter "ipython"
;;  python-shell-interpreter-args ""
;;  python-shell-prompt-regexp "In \\[[0-9]+\\]: "
;;  python-shell-prompt-output-regexp "Out\\[[0-9]+\\]: "
;;  python-shell-completion-setup-code
;;    "from IPython.core.completerlib import module_completion"
;;  python-shell-completion-module-string-code
;;    "';'.join(module_completion('''%s'''))\n"
;;  python-shell-completion-string-code
;;    "';'.join(get_ipython().Completer.all_completions('''%s'''))\n")

;; For iPython 0.10 everything would be the same except for
;; `python-shell-completion-string-code' and
;; `python-shell-completion-module-string-code':

;; (setq python-shell-completion-string-code
;;       "';'.join(__IP.complete('''%s'''))\n"
;;       python-shell-completion-module-string-code "")

;; Unfortunately running iPython on Windows needs some more tweaking.
;; The way you must set `python-shell-interpreter' and
;; `python-shell-interpreter-args' is as follows:

;; (setq
;;  python-shell-interpreter "C:\\Python27\\python.exe"
;;  python-shell-interpreter-args
;;  "-i C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\ipython-script.py")

;; That will spawn the iPython process correctly (Of course you need
;; to modify the paths according to your system).

;; Please note that the default completion system depends on the
;; readline module, so if you are using some Operating System that
;; bundles Python without it (like Windows) just install the
;; pyreadline from http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/PyReadline/Intro and
;; you should be good to go.

;; Shell virtualenv support: The shell also contains support for
;; virtualenvs and other special environment modifications thanks to
;; `python-shell-process-environment' and `python-shell-exec-path'.
;; These two variables allows you to modify execution paths and
;; environment variables to make easy for you to setup virtualenv rules
;; or behavior modifications when running shells.  Here is an example
;; of how to make shell processes to be run using the /path/to/env/
;; virtualenv:

;; (setq python-shell-process-environment
;;       (list
;;        (format "PATH=%s" (mapconcat
;;                           'identity
;;                           (reverse
;;                            (cons (getenv "PATH")
;;                                  '("/path/to/env/bin/")))
;;                           ":"))
;;        "VIRTUAL_ENV=/path/to/env/"))
;; (python-shell-exec-path . ("/path/to/env/bin/"))

;; Since the above is cumbersome and can be programatically
;; calculated, the variable `python-shell-virtualenv-path' is
;; provided.  When this variable is set with the path of the
;; virtualenv to use, `process-environment' and `exec-path' get proper
;; values in order to run shells inside the specified virtualenv.  So
;; the following will achieve the same as the previous example:

;; (setq python-shell-virtualenv-path "/path/to/env/")

;; Also the `python-shell-extra-pythonpaths' variable have been
;; introduced as simple way of adding paths to the PYTHONPATH without
;; affecting existing values.

;; Pdb tracking: when you execute a block of code that contains some
;; call to pdb (or ipdb) it will prompt the block of code and will
;; follow the execution of pdb marking the current line with an arrow.

;; Symbol completion: you can complete the symbol at point.  It uses
;; the shell completion in background so you should run
;; `python-shell-send-buffer' from time to time to get better results.

;; Skeletons: 6 skeletons are provided for simple inserting of class,
;; def, for, if, try and while.  These skeletons are integrated with
;; dabbrev.  If you have `dabbrev-mode' activated and
;; `python-skeleton-autoinsert' is set to t, then whenever you type
;; the name of any of those defined and hit SPC, they will be
;; automatically expanded.

;; FFAP: You can find the filename for a given module when using ffap
;; out of the box.  This feature needs an inferior python shell
;; running.

;; Code check: Check the current file for errors with `python-check'
;; using the program defined in `python-check-command'.

;; Eldoc: returns documentation for object at point by using the
;; inferior python subprocess to inspect its documentation.  As you
;; might guessed you should run `python-shell-send-buffer' from time
;; to time to get better results too.

;; imenu: This mode supports imenu.  It builds a plain or tree menu
;; depending on the value of `python-imenu-make-tree'.  Also you can
;; customize if menu items should include its type using
;; `python-imenu-include-defun-type'.

;; If you used python-mode.el you probably will miss auto-indentation
;; when inserting newlines.  To achieve the same behavior you have
;; two options:

;; 1) Use GNU/Emacs' standard binding for `newline-and-indent': C-j.

;; 2) Add the following hook in your .emacs:

;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
;;   #'(lambda ()
;;       (define-key python-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))

;; I'd recommend the first one since you'll get the same behavior for
;; all modes out-of-the-box.

;;; Installation:

;; Add this to your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
;; (require 'python)

;;; TODO:
