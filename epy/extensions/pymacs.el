;;; Commentary:

;; Pymacs is a powerful tool which, once started from Emacs, allows
;; both-way communication between Emacs Lisp and Python.  Pymacs aims
;; Python as an extension language for Emacs rather than the other way
;; around.  Visit http://pymacs.progiciels-bpi.ca to read its manual,
;; which also contains installation instructions.

;;; Code:

;; The code is organized into pages, grouping declarations by topic.
;; Such pages are introduced by a form feed and a topic description.

  "Communication buffer between Emacs and Python.")

;; The principle behind the communication protocol is that it is easier to
;; generate than parse, and that each language already has its own parser.
;; So, the Emacs side generates Python text for the Python side to interpret,
;; while the Python side generates Lisp text for the Lisp side to interpret.
;; About nothing but expressions are transmitted, which are evaluated on
;; arrival.  The pseudo `reply' function is meant to signal the final result
;; of a series of exchanges following a request, while the pseudo `error'
;; function is meant to explain why an exchange could not have been completed.

;; The protocol itself is rather simple, and contains human readable text
;; only.  A message starts at the beginning of a line in the communication
;; buffer, either with `>' for the Lisp to Python direction, or `<' for the
;; Python to Lisp direction.  This is followed by a decimal number giving the
;; length of the message text, a TAB character, and the message text itself.
;; Message direction alternates systematically between messages, it never
;; occurs that two successive messages are sent in the same direction.  The
;; first message is received from the Python side, it is `(version VERSION)'.
