  other minor modes.

* Document refinement and released with YASnippet. Most of the Online
  wiki document will be deprecated soon.
* Powerful condition system added to yasnippet!

  selecting multiple candidates. Thanks to `Jaeyoun Chung

  ``indent-region`` or ``fill-region`` after finish the snippet.
* Use minor-mode instead of ``global-set-key`` to bind the trigger
  key. Now the trigger key and fall-back behavior can be more
  flexible. Not constrained to ``<tab>``. Thanks to Trey Jackson. See
  this `thread
  <https://groups.google.com/group/smart-snippet/browse_thread/thread/937f32a2a6dea4f2?hl=en>`_
  for more details.

  avoid sometimes missed hook calls. See `issue 3
  <http://code.google.com/p/yasnippet/issues/detail?id=3>`_ for more
  details.
* Support parent snippet table. Now you can set (for example)
  ``cc-mode`` as common mode for ``c++-mode``, ``c-mode`` and
