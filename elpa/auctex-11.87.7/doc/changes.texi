@chapheading Changes and New Features in @AUCTeX{}

@end ifset

@heading News since 11.87

@itemize @bullet
@item
@AUCTeX{} now supports Biber in conjunction with biblatex in addition to
BibTeX.

@item
Each @AUCTeX{} mode now has its own abbrev table.  On Emacsen which
provide the possibility to inherit abbrevs from other tables, the
abbrevs from the Text mode abbrev table are available as well.  Newly
defined abbrevs are written to the mode-specific tables, though.

@item
The file @samp{tex-fptex.el} was removed.

@item
Forward/backward search for Evince has been improved.  If Emacs is
compiled with DBUS support and a recent Evince version (3.x) is
installed, the communication goes over the desktop bus instead of the
command line, resulting in more accurate positioning of point in Emacs
and highlighting of the target paragraph in Evince.

@item
A problem where Ghostscript threw an /invalidfileaccess error when
running @previewlatex{} was fixed.

@item
A lot of smaller fixes and additions have been made.
@end itemize


@heading News in 11.86

@itemize @bullet
@item
Parsing of @LaTeX{} output was improved.  It is now less likely that
@AUCTeX{} opens a non-existent file upon calling @code{TeX-next-error};
a problem for example encountered when using MiK@TeX{} 2.8.  In addition
quoted file names as emitted by MiK@TeX{} are now supported.

@item
A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you will have
to redo them in this new framework or reenable the old one.
@ifset rawfile
See the section on viewers in the manual for details.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Starting Viewers}, for details.
@end ifclear

@item
Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.

@item
Support for various @LaTeX{} packages was added, e.g. @samp{tabularx},
@samp{CJK}, and @samp{hyperref}.

@item
An easy way to switch between @TeX{} engines (PDF@TeX{}, Lua@TeX{},
Xe@TeX{}, Omega) was added.

@item
Support for Sync@TeX{} was added.  This involves the command line
options for @LaTeX{} and the viewer.

@item
Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
text.

@item
@samp{preview.sty} now works with Xe@TeX{}.

@item
A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.85

@itemize @bullet

@item
Font locking has been improved significantly.  It is now less prone to
color bleeding which could lead to high resource usage.  In addition it
now includes information about @LaTeX{} macro syntax and can indicate
syntactically incorrect macros in @LaTeX{} mode.

@item
The license was updated to GPLv3.

@item
Support for the nomencl, flashcards and comment @LaTeX{} packages as
well as the Icelandic language option of babel were added.

@item
Support for folding of math macros was added.

@item
Lots of minor bugs in features and documentation fixed.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.84

@itemize @bullet

@item
There have been problems with the @samp{-without-texmf-dir} option to
@samp{configure} when the value of @samp{-with-kpathsea-sep} was set or
determined for an installation system with a default different from that
of the runtime system.  @code{with-kpathsea-sep} has been removed; the
setting is now usually determined at runtime.

Due to this and other problems, preview-latex in the released XEmacs
package failed under Windows or with anything except recent 21.5
XEmacsen.

@item
@AUCTeX{} and @previewlatex{} have been changed in order to accommodate
file names containing spaces.  @previewlatex{} now tolerates bad
PostScript code polluting the stack (like some Omega fonts).

@item
@samp{preview.sty} had in some cases failed to emit PostScript header
specials.

@item
Support for folding of comments was added.

@item
The @code{polish} language option of the babel LaTeX package as well as
the polski LaTeX package are now supported.  Most notably this means
that AUCTeX will help to insert quotation marks as defined by polish.sty
(@code{"`..."'}) and polski.sty (@code{,,...''}).

@item
The @TeX{} tool bar is now available and enabled by default in plain
@TeX{} mode.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Processing Facilities}.
@end ifclear

@item
Bug fix in the display of math subscripts and superscripts.

@item
Bug fix @code{TeX-doc} for Emacs 21.

@item
There has been quite a number of other bug fixes to various features and
documentation across the board.

@end itemize

@heading News in 11.83

@itemize @bullet
@item
The new function @code{TeX-doc} provides easy access to documentation
about commands and packages or information related to @TeX{} and friends
in general.
@ifset rawfile
It is accessible with the key binding @kbd{C-c ?} or the
@samp{Find Documentation...} entry in the mode menus.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Documentation}.
@end ifclear

@item
You can now get rid of generated intermediate and output files by means
of the new @samp{Clean} and @samp{Clean All} entries in
@code{TeX-command-list} accessible with @kbd{C-c C-c} or the Command
menu.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Cleaning}.
@end ifclear

@item
Support for forward search with PDF files was added.  That means you can
jump to a place in the output file corresponding to the position in the
source file.
@ifset rawfile
Currently this only works if you use the pdfsync @LaTeX{} package and
xpdf as your PDF viewer.  The accuracy is in the range of +/-1 page.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Viewing}.
@end ifclear

Adding support for this feature required the default value of the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style} to be changed.  Please make sure
you either remove any customizations overriding the new default or
incorporate the changes into your customizations if you want to use this
feature.

@item
@TeX{} error messages of the @code{-file-line-error} kind are now
understood in @AUCTeX{} and @previewlatex{} (parsers are still
separate).

@item
Bug fix in XyM@TeX{} support.

@item
The @LaTeX{} tool bar is now enabled by default.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Processing Facilities}.
@end ifclear

@end itemize

@heading News in 11.82

@itemize @bullet
@item
Support for the MinionPro LaTeX package was added.

@item
Warnings and underfull/overfull boxes are now being indicated in the
echo area after a @LaTeX{} run, if the respective debugging options are
activated with @code{TeX-toggle-debug-warnings} (@kbd{C-c C-t C-w}) or
@code{TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes} (@kbd{C-c C-t C-b}).  In this case
@code{TeX-next-error} will find these warnings in addition to normal
errors.

The key binding @kbd{C-c C-w} for @code{TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes}
(which was renamed from @code{TeX-toggle-debug-boxes}) now is
deprecated.

@item
@AUCTeX{} now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
@key{_} or @key{^} in math constructs if the new variable
@code{TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript} is set to a non-nil value.

@item
Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
completion support for the commands provided by the @samp{frenchb} (and
@samp{francais}) options of the babel @LaTeX{} package and easier input
of French quotation marks (@code{\\og ...\\fg}) which can now be
inserted by typing @key{"}.

@item
Completion support for options of some LaTeX packages was added.

@item
@cindex @file{auctex.el}
@cindex @file{tex-site.el}
Already in version 11.81 the way to activate @AUCTeX{} changed
substantially.  This should now be done with @code{(load "auctex.el" nil
t t)} instead of the former @code{(require 'tex-site)}.  Related to this
change @file{tex-mik.el} does not load @file{tex-site.el} anymore.  That
means if you used only @code{(require 'tex-mik)} in order to activate
@AUCTeX{}, you have to add @code{(load "auctex.el" nil t t)} before the
latter statement.
@ifset rawfile
More detailed information can be found in the installation instructions
(file INSTALL).
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Loading the package}.
@end ifclear

@item
Handling of verbatim constructs was consolidated across AUCTeX.  This
resulted in the @fontlatex{}-specific variables
@code{font-latex-verb-like-commands}, @code{font-latex-verbatim-macros},
and @code{font-latex-verbatim-environments} being removed and the more
general variables @code{LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims},
@code{LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces}, and
@code{LaTeX-verbatim-environments} being added.

@item
The output of a Bib@TeX{} run is now checked for warnings and errors,
which are reported in the echo area.

@item
The aliases for @code{font-latex-title-fontify} were removed.  Use
@code{font-latex-fontify-sectioning} instead.

@item
The problem that Japanese macros where broken across lines was fixed.

@item
Various bug fixes.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.81

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{LaTeX-mark-section} now marks subsections of a given section as
well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

@item
@previewlatex{} which was previously available separately became a
subsystem of @AUCTeX{}.  There is no documented provision for building
or installing @previewlatex{} separately.  It is still possible to use
and install @AUCTeX{} without @previewlatex{}, however.

@item
The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also install
startup files as part of the process (those had to be copied manually
previously).  You are advised to remove previous installations of
@AUCTeX{} and @previewlatex{} before starting the installation
procedure.  A standard installation from an unmodified tarball no longer
requires Makeinfo or Perl.

Also note that the way @AUCTeX{} is supposed to be activated changed.
Instead of @code{(require 'tex-site)} you should now use @code{(load
"auctex.el" nil t t)}.  While the former method may still work, the new
method has the advantage that you can deactivate a preactivated
@AUCTeX{} with the statement @code{(unload-feature 'tex-site)} before
any of its modes have been used.  This may be important especially for
site-wide installations.

@item
Support for the babel @LaTeX{} package was added.

@item
Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified before
the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in unbearably long
execution times, you can fall back to the old behavior of relying on
stealth font locking to do this job in the background by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-fold-force-fontify}.

@item
Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip or the
echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

@item
The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was generalized.  The
variables @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote}, @code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote},
@code{LaTeX-italian-open-quote}, @code{LaTeX-italian-close-quote}, and
@code{LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote} are now obsolete.  If you are not
satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
@code{TeX-quote-language-alist} instead.

@item
Similar to language-specific quote insertion, @AUCTeX{} now helps you
with hyphens in different languages as well.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{European}, for details.
@end ifclear

@item
Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in @AUCTeX{} 11.55 were fixed.
@AUCTeX{} tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte chars.
These features will work in Chinese text, too.

@item
The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can now
be customized using the variable @code{font-latex-fontify-sectioning}.
This variable was previously called @code{font-latex-title-fontify}; In
this release we provide an alias but this will disappear in one of the
the next releases.  The faces for the sectioning commands are now called
@code{font-latex-sectioning-@var{N}-face} (@var{N}=0@dots{}5) instead of
@code{font-latex-title-@var{N}-face} (@var{N}=1@dots{}4).  Analogously
the names of the variables holding the related keyword lists were
changed from @code{font-latex-title-@var{N}-keywords} to
@code{font-latex-sectioning-@var{N}-keywords}.
@ifclear rawfile
@xref{Font Locking}, for details.
@end ifclear
Make sure to adjust your customizations.

@item
Titles in beamer slides marked by the ``\frametitle'' command are know
displayed with the new face @code{font-latex-slide-title-face}.  You can
add macros to be highlighted with this face to
@code{font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords}.

@item
Of course a lot of bugs have been fixed.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.55

@itemize @bullet
@item
A bug was fixed which lead to the insertion of trailing whitespace
during filling.  In particular extra spaces were added to sentence
endings at the end of lines.  You can make this whitespace visible by
setting the variable @code{show-trailing-whitespace} to @code{t}.  If
you want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type @kbd{M-x
delete-trailing-whitespace RET}.

@item
A bug was fixed which lead to a @samp{*Compile-Log*} buffer popping up
when the first @LaTeX{} file was loaded in an Emacs session.

@item
On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead to
the error message @samp{File mode specification error: (error "Variable
binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size")}.  Precautions were added which
prevent this error from happening.  But nevertheless, it is advised to
upgrade or uninstall the outdated Emacspeak package.

@item
The value of @code{TeX-macro-global} is not determined during
configuration anymore but at load time of @AUCTeX{}.  Consequently the
associated configuration option @samp{--with-tex-input-dirs} was
removed.

@item
Support for the @LaTeX{} Japanese classes @samp{jsarticle} and
@samp{jsbook} was added.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.54

@itemize @bullet
@item
The parser (used e.g. for @code{TeX-auto-generate-global}) was extended
to recognize keywords common in @LaTeX{} packages and classes, like
``\DeclareRobustCommand'' or ``\RequirePackage''.  Additionally a bug
was fixed which led to duplicate entries in @AUCTeX{} style files.

@item
Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new @code{TeX-fold-dwim}
command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key binding.
In course of these changes new key bindings for unfolding commands where
introduced.  The old bindings are still present but will be phased out
in future releases.

@item
Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

@item
There is an experimental tool bar support now.  It is not activated by
default.  If you want to use it, add
@lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
@end lisp
to your init file.

@item
The manual now contains a new chapter ``Quick Start''.  It explains the
main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a new user
to start using @AUCTeX{}.

@item
A new section ``Font Locking'' was added to the manual which explains
syntax highlighting in @AUCTeX{} and its customization.  Together with
the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part of
the new chapter ``Display''.

@item
Keywords for syntax highlighting of @LaTeX{} constructs to be typeset in
bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.  Besides the
built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by customizing the
variable @samp{font-latex-user-keyword-classes}.  The customization
options can be found in the customization group
@samp{font-latex-keywords}.

@item
Verbatim content is now displayed with the @samp{fixed-pitch} face. (GNU
Emacs only)

@item
Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
anymore. (GNU Emacs only)

@item
Verbatim commands like @samp{\verb|...|} will not be broken anymore
during filling.

@item
You can customize the completion for graphic files with 
@code{LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file}.

@item
Support for the @LaTeX{} packages @samp{url}, @samp{listings},
@samp{jurabib} and @samp{csquotes} was added with regard to command
completion and syntax highlighting.

@item
Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

@item
Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of existing
node names.

@item
Setting the variable @code{LaTeX-float} to @code{nil} now means that you
will not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.  You
can get the old behaviour of @code{nil} by setting the variable to
@code{""}, i.e. an empty string.
@ifclear rawfile
See also @ref{Floats}.
@end ifclear

@item
The XEmacs-specific bug concerning @code{overlays-at} was fixed.

@item
Lots of bug fixes.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.53

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @LaTeX{} math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
built supports it.  See the variable
@ifset rawfile
@code{LaTeX-math-menu-unicode}.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@code{LaTeX-math-menu-unicode}, @ref{Mathematics}.
@end ifclear

@item
Bug fixes for XEmacs.

@c The following items weren't present at release time of 11.53:
@item
Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

@item
@command{start} is used for the viewer for MiK@TeX{} and fp@TeX{}.

@item
The variable @code{TeX-fold-preserve-comments} can now be customized to
deactivate folding in comments.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.52
@c Not present at release time of 11.52.

@itemize @bullet
@item

fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

@item
Bug fixes in the build process.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.51
@c Not present at release time of 11.51.

@itemize @bullet
@item
PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt,
this has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

@item
Omega support has been added.

@item
Bug fixes in the build process.

@item
@code{TeX-fold} now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.
@end itemize

@heading News in 11.50

@itemize @bullet
@item
The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document can
now be controlled with the new @code{TeX-source-specials} minor mode
which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key binding
@kbd{C-c C-t C-s}.  If you have customized the variable
@code{TeX-command-list}, you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by typing
@code{M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET}, selecting
``Erase Customization'' and do your customization again with the new
default.

@item
The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain @TeX{},
@LaTeX{}, @ConTeXt{} etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
@code{TeX-command-list} has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
and the customization will not work correctly.

@item
Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g. footnotes or
citations, and environments in a buffer was
@ifset rawfile
added.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
added, @ref{Folding}.
@end ifclear

@item
You can now control if indentation is done upon typing @key{RET} by
customizing the variable
@ifset rawfile
@code{TeX-newline-function}.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
@code{TeX-newline-function}, @ref{Indenting}.
@end ifclear

@item
Limited support for @code{doc.sty} and @code{ltxdoc.cls} (@samp{dtx}
files) was added.  The new doc@TeX{} mode provides functionality for
editing documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while staying
in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note that the mode
is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting does not work yet
in XEmacs.)

@item
For macro completion in doc@TeX{} mode the @AUCTeX{} style files
@file{doc.el}, @file{ltxdoc.el} and @file{ltx-base.el} were included.
The latter provides general support for low-level @LaTeX{} macros and
may be used with @LaTeX{} class and style files as well.  It is
currently not loaded automatically for those files.

@item
Support for @ConTeXt{} with a separate @ConTeXt{} mode is now included.
Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and English.

@item
The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
available functionality and customization options are explained in the
manual.

@item
Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line previews.
@AUCTeX{} now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

@item
If @code{TeX-master} is set to @code{t}, @AUCTeX{} will now query for a
master file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
alone.  The new function @code{TeX-master-file-ask} (bound to @kbd{C-c
_} is provided for adding the variable manually.

@item
Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display devices
which support such fontification.  The variable
@code{font-latex-title-fontify} can be customized to restore the old
appearance, i.e. the usage of a different color instead of a change in
size.

@item
Support for @code{alphanum.sty}, @code{beamer.cls}, @code{booktabs.sty},
@code{captcont.sty}, @code{emp.sty}, @code{paralist.sty},
@code{subfigure.sty} and @code{units.sty}/@code{nicefrac.sty} was added.
Credits go to the authors mentioned in the respective @AUCTeX{} style
files.

@item
Inserting graphics with @kbd{C-c RET \includegraphics RET} was improved.
See the variable @code{LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist}.
@c FIXME: Document this in the main part of the manual

@item
If @code{LaTeX-default-position} is @code{nil}, don't prompt for
position arguments in Tabular-like
@ifset rawfile
environments.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
environments, see @ref{Tabular-like}.
@end ifclear

@item
Completion for available packages when using @kbd{C-c RET \usepackage
RET} was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

@item
The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for paragraphs
and regions respectively which do both.

@item
Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited by
either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the variable
@code{font-latex-quotes}.

@item
Certain @TeX{}/@LaTeX{} keywords for functions, references, variables
and warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
keywords by customizing the variables
@code{font-latex-match-function-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-reference-keywords},
@code{font-latex-match-variable-keywords} and
@code{font-latex-match-warning-keywords}.

@item
If you include the style files @file{german} or @file{ngerman} in a
document (directly or via the @samp{babel} package), you should now
customize @code{LaTeX-german-open-quote},
@code{LaTeX-german-close-quote} and
@code{LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote} instead of @code{TeX-open-quote},
@code{TeX-close-quote} and @code{TeX-quote-after-quote} if you want to
influence the type of quote insertion.

@item
Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line options
for it are now determined automatically by looking at the extension of
the output file and certain options used in the source file.  The
behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by customizing the
variable @code{TeX-output-view-style}.

@item
You can control whether @code{TeX-insert-macro} (@kbd{C-c RET}) ask for
all optional arguments by customizing the variable
@ifset rawfile
@code{TeX-insert-macro-default-style}.
@end ifset
@ifclear rawfile
