This manual may be copied under the conditions spelled out in *note
Copying this Manual::.

   AUCTeX is an integrated environment for editing LaTeX, ConTeXt,
docTeX, Texinfo, and TeX files.

   Although AUCTeX contains a large number of features, there are no
reasons to despair.  You can continue to write TeX and LaTeX documents
the way you are used to, and only start using the multiple features in
small steps.  AUCTeX is not monolithic, each feature described in this
manual is useful by itself, but together they provide an environment
where you will make very few LaTeX errors, and makes it easy to find the
errors that may slip through anyway.

   It is a good idea to make a printout of AUCTeX's reference card
'tex-ref.tex' or one of its typeset versions.

   If you want to make AUCTeX aware of style files and multi-file
documents right away, insert the following in your '.emacs' file.

     (setq TeX-auto-save t)
     (setq TeX-parse-self t)
     (setq-default TeX-master nil)

   Another thing you should enable is RefTeX, a comprehensive solution
for managing cross references, bibliographies, indices, document
navigation and a few other things.  (*note (reftex)Installation::)

   For detailed information about the preview-latex subsystem of AUCTeX,
see *note Introduction: (preview-latex)Top.

   There is a mailing list for general discussion about AUCTeX: write a
mail with "subscribe" in the subject to <auctex-request@gnu.org> to join
it.  Send contributions to <auctex@gnu.org>.

   Bug reports should go to <bug-auctex@gnu.org>, suggestions for new
features, and pleas for help should go to either <auctex-devel@gnu.org>
(the AUCTeX developers), or to <auctex@gnu.org> if they might have

Copying
*******

AUCTeX primarily consists of Lisp files for Emacs (and XEmacs), but
there are also installation scripts and files and TeX support files.
All of those are "free"; this means that everyone is free to use them
and free to redistribute them on a free basis.  The files of AUCTeX are
not in the public domain; they are copyrighted and there are
restrictions on their distribution, but these restrictions are designed
to permit everything that a good cooperating citizen would want to do.
What is not allowed is to try to prevent others from further sharing any
version of these programs that they might get from you.

   Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to give
away copies of the files that constitute AUCTeX, that you receive source
code or else can get it if you want it, that you can change these files
or use pieces of them in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

   To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of parts of AUCTeX, you must give the recipients all the rights
that you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get
the source code.  And you must tell them their rights.

   Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone
finds out that there is no warranty for AUCTeX.  If any parts are
modified by someone else and passed on, we want their recipients to know
that what they have is not what we distributed, so that any problems
introduced by others will not reflect on our reputation.

   The precise conditions of the licenses for the files currently being
distributed as part of AUCTeX are found in the General Public Licenses
that accompany them.  This manual specifically is covered by the GNU
Free Documentation License (*note Copying this Manual::).

1.1 Overview of AUCTeX
======================

AUCTeX is a comprehensive customizable integrated environment for
writing input files for TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt, Texinfo, and docTeX using
Emacs or XEmacs.

   It supports you in the insertion of macros, environments, and
sectioning commands by providing completion alternatives and prompting
for parameters.  It automatically indents your text as you type it and
lets you format a whole file at once.  The outlining and folding
facilities provide you with a focused and clean view of your text.

   AUCTeX lets you process your source files by running TeX and related
tools (such as output filters, post processors for generating indices
and bibliographies, and viewers) from inside Emacs.  AUCTeX lets you
browse through the errors TeX reported, while it moves the cursor
directly to the reported error, and displays some documentation for that
particular error.  This will even work when the document is spread over
several files.

   One component of AUCTeX that LaTeX users will find attractive is
preview-latex, a combination of folding and in-source previewing that
provides true "What You See Is What You Get" experience in your
sourcebuffer, while letting you retain full control.

   More detailed information about the features and usage of AUCTeX can
be found in the remainder of this manual.

   AUCTeX is written entirely in Emacs Lisp, and hence you can easily
add new features for your own needs.  It is a GNU project and
distributed under the 'GNU General Public License Version 3'.

   The most recent version is always available at
<http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/auctex/>.

   WWW users may want to check out the AUCTeX page at
<http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/>.

   For comprehensive information about how to install AUCTeX *Note
Installation::, or *note Installation under MS Windows::, respectively.

   If you are considering upgrading AUCTeX, the recent changes are
described in *note Changes::.

   If you want to discuss AUCTeX with other users or its developers,
there are several mailing lists you can use.

   Send a mail with the subject "subscribe" to <auctex-request@gnu.org>
in order to join the general discussion list for AUCTeX.  Articles
should be sent to <auctex@gnu.org>.  In a similar way, you can subscribe
to the <info-auctex@gnu.org> list for just getting important
announcements about AUCTeX.  The list <bug-auctex@gnu.org> is for bug
reports which you should usually file with the 'M-x
TeX-submit-bug-report <RET>' command.  If you want to address the
developers of AUCTeX themselves with technical issues, they can be found
on the discussion list <auctex-devel@gnu.org>.

1.2 Installing AUCTeX
=====================

The simplest way of installing AUCTeX is by using the Emacs package
manager integrated in Emacs 24 and greater (ELPA).  Simply do 'M-x
package-list-packages RET', mark the auctex package for installation
with 'i', and hit 'x' to execute the installation procedure.  That's
all.

   The remainder of this section is about installing AUCTeX from a
release tarball or from a checkout of the AUCTeX repository.

   Installing AUCTeX should be simple: merely './configure', 'make', and
'make install' for a standard site-wide installation (most other
installations can be done by specifying a '--prefix=...' option).

   On many systems, this will already activate the package, making its
modes the default instead of the built-in modes of Emacs.  If this is
not the case, consult *note Loading the package::.  Please read through
this document fully before installing anything.  The installation
procedure has changed as compared to earlier versions.  Users of MS Windows
are asked to consult *Note Installation under MS Windows::.

1.2.1 Prerequisites
-------------------

   * A recent version of Emacs, alternatively XEmacs

     Emacs 20 is no longer supported, and neither is XEmacs with a
     version of 'xemacs-base' older than 1.84 (released in sumo from
     02/02/2004).  Using preview-latex requires a version of Emacs
     compiled with image support.  While the X11 version of Emacs 21
     will likely work, Emacs 22 and later is preferred.

     Windows
          Precompiled versions are available from
          <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/>.
     Mac OS X
          For an overview of precompiled versions of Emacs for Mac OS X
          see for example
          <http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsForMacOS>.
     GNU/Linux
          Most GNU/Linux distributions nowadays provide a recent variant
          of Emacs via their package repositories.
     Self-compiled
          Compiling Emacs yourself requires a C compiler and a number of
          tools and development libraries.  Details are beyond the scope
          of this manual.  Instructions for checking out the source code
          can be found at <https://savannah.gnu.org/bzr/?group=emacs>.

     If you really need to use Emacs 21 on platforms where this implies
     missing image support, you should disable the installation of
     preview-latex (see below).

     While XEmacs (version 21.4.15, 21.4.17 or later) is supported,
     doing this in a satisfactory manner has proven to be difficult.
     This is mostly due to technical shortcomings and differing API's
     which are hard to come by.  If AUCTeX is your main application for
     XEmacs, you are likely to get better results and support by
     switching to Emacs.  Of course, you can improve support for your
     favorite editor by giving feedback in case you encounter bugs.

   * A working TeX installation

     Well, AUCTeX would be pointless without that.  Processing
     documentation requires TeX, LaTeX and Texinfo during installation.
     preview-latex requires Dvips for its operation in DVI mode.  The
     default configuration of AUCTeX is tailored for teTeX or
     TeXlive-based distributions, but can be adapted easily.

   * A recent Ghostscript

     This is needed for operation of preview-latex in both DVI and PDF
     mode.  Most versions of Ghostscript nowadays in use should work
     fine (version 7.0 and newer).

   * The 'texinfo' package

     Strictly speaking, you can get away without it if you are building
     from the distribution tarball, have not modified any files and
     don't need a printed version of the manual: the pregenerated info
     file is included in the tarball.  At least version 4.0 is required.

   For some known issues with various software, see *note
(preview-latex)Known problems::.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Configure,  Next: Build/install,  Prev: Prerequisites,  Up: Installation

1.2.2 Configure
---------------

The first step is to configure the source code, telling it where various
files will be.  To do so, run

     ./configure OPTIONS

   (Note: if you have fetched AUCTeX from Git rather than a regular
release, you will have to first follow the instructions in
'README.GIT').

   On many machines, you will not need to specify any options, but if
'configure' cannot determine something on its own, you'll need to help
it out with one of these options:

'--prefix=/usr/local'
     All automatic placements for package components will be chosen from
     sensible existing hierarchies below this: directories like 'man',
     'share' and 'bin' are supposed to be directly below PREFIX.

     Only if no workable placement can be found there, in some cases an
     alternative search will be made in a prefix deduced from a suitable
     binary.

     '/usr/local' is the default PREFIX, intended to be suitable for a
     site-wide installation.  If you are packaging this as an operating
     system component for distribution, the setting '/usr' will probably
     be the right choice.  If you are planning to install the package as
     a single non-priviledged user, you will typically set PREFIX to
     your home directory.

'--with-emacs[=/PATH/TO/EMACS]'
     If you are using a pretest which isn't in your '$PATH', or
     'configure' is not finding the right Emacs executable, you can
     specify it with this option.

'--with-xemacs[=/PATH/TO/XEMACS]'
     Configure for generation under XEmacs (Emacs is the default).
     Again, the name of the right XEmacs executable can be specified,
     complete with path if necessary.

'--with-packagedir=/DIR'
     This XEmacs-only option configures the directory for XEmacs
     packages.  A typical user-local setting would be
     '~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages'.  If this directory exists and is below
     PREFIX, it should be detected automatically.  This will install and
     activate the package.

'--without-packagedir'
     This XEmacs-only option switches the detection of a package
     directory and corresponding installation off.  Consequently, the
     Emacs installation scheme will be used.  This might be appropriate
     if you are using a different package system/installer than the
     XEmacs one and want to avoid conflicts.

     The Emacs installation scheme has the following options:

'--with-lispdir=/DIR'
     This Emacs-only option specifies the location of the 'site-lisp'
     directory within 'load-path' under which the files will get
     installed (the bulk will get installed in a subdirectory).
     './configure' should figure this out by itself.

'--with-auctexstartfile=auctex.el'
'--with-previewstartfile=preview-latex.el'
     This is the name of the respective startup files.  If LISPDIR
     contains a subdirectory 'site-start.d', the start files are placed
     there, and 'site-start.el' should load them automatically.  Please
     be aware that you must not move the start files after installation
     since other files are found _relative_ to them.

'--with-packagelispdir=auctex'
     This is the directory where the bulk of the package gets located.
     The startfile adds this into LOAD-PATH.

'--with-auto-dir=/DIR'
     You can use this option to specify the directory containing
     automatically generated information.  It is not necessary for most
     TeX installs, but may be used if you don't like the directory that
     configure is suggesting.

'--help'
     This is not an option specific to AUCTeX.  A number of standard
     options to 'configure' exist, and we do not have the room to
     describe them here; a short description of each is available, using
     '--help'.  If you use '--help=recursive', then also
     preview-latex-specific options will get listed.

'--disable-preview'
     This disables configuration and installation of preview-latex.
     This option is not actually recommended.  If your Emacs does not
     support images, you should really upgrade to a newer version.
     Distributors should, if possible, refrain from distributing AUCTeX
     and preview-latex separately in order to avoid confusion and
     upgrade hassles if users install partial packages on their own.

'--with-texmf-dir=/DIR
--without-texmf-dir'
     This option is used for specifying a TDS-compliant directory
     hierarchy.  Using '--with-texmf-dir=/DIR' you can specify where the
     TeX TDS directory hierarchy resides, and the TeX files will get
     installed in '/DIR/tex/latex/preview/'.

     If you use the '--without-texmf-dir' option, the TeX-related files
     will be kept in the Emacs Lisp tree, and at runtime the 'TEXINPUTS'
     environment variable will be made to point there.  You can install
     those files into your own TeX tree at some later time with 'M-x
     preview-install-styles RET'.

'--with-tex-dir=/DIR'
     If you want to specify an exact directory for the preview TeX
     files, use '--with-tex-dir=/DIR'.  In this case, the files will be
     placed in '/DIR', and you'll also need the following option:

'--with-doc-dir=/DIR'
     This option may be used to specify where the TeX documentation
     goes.  It is to be used when you are using '--with-tex-dir=/DIR',
     but is normally not necessary otherwise.

1.2.3 Build/install
-------------------

Once 'configure' has been run, simply enter

     make

at the prompt to byte-compile the lisp files, extract the TeX files and
build the documentation files.  To install the files into the locations
chosen earlier, type

     make install

   You may need special privileges to install, e.g., if you are
installing into system directories.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Loading the package,  Next: Advice for package providers,  Prev: Build/install,  Up: Installation

1.2.4 Loading the package
-------------------------

You can detect the successful activation of AUCTeX and preview-latex in
the menus after loading a LaTeX file like 'preview/circ.tex': AUCTeX
then gives you a 'Command' menu, and preview-latex gives you a 'Preview'
menu.

   For XEmacs, if the installation occured into a valid package
directory (which is the default), then this should work out of the box.

   With Emacs (or if you explicitly disabled use of the package system),
the startup files 'auctex.el' and 'preview-latex.el' may already be in a
directory of the 'site-start.d/' variety if your Emacs installation
provides it.  In that case they should be automatically loaded on
startup and nothing else needs to be done.  If not, they should at least
have been placed somewhere in your 'load-path'.  You can then load them
by placing the lines

     (load "auctex.el" nil t t)
     (load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)

   into your init file.

   If you explicitly used '--with-lispdir', you may need to add the
specified directory into Emacs' 'load-path' variable by adding something
like

     (add-to-list 'load-path "~/elisp")

   before the above lines into your Emacs startup file.

   For site-wide activation in GNU Emacs, see *Note Advice for package
providers::.

   Once activated, the modes provided by AUCTeX are used per default for
all supported file types.  If you want to change the modes for which it
is operative instead of the default, use
     M-x customize-variable <RET> TeX-modes <RET>

   If you want to remove a preinstalled AUCTeX completely before any of
its modes have been used,
     (unload-feature 'tex-site)
   should accomplish that.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Advice for package providers,  Next: Advice for non-privileged users,  Prev: Loading the package,  Up: Installation

1.2.5 Providing AUCTeX as a package
-----------------------------------

As a package provider, you should make sure that your users will be
served best according to their intentions, and keep in mind that a
system might be used by more than one user, with different preferences.

   There are people that prefer the built-in Emacs modes for editing TeX
files, in particular plain TeX users.  There are various ways to tell
AUCTeX even after auto-activation that it should not get used, and they
are described in *note Introduction to AUCTeX: Introduction.

   So if you have users that don't want to use the preinstalled AUCTeX,
they can easily get rid of it.  Activating AUCTeX by default is
therefore a good choice.

   If the installation procedure did not achieve this already by placing
'auctex.el' and 'preview-latex.el' into a possibly existing
'site-start.d' directory, you can do this by placing

     (load "auctex.el" nil t t)
     (load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)

in the system-wide 'site-start.el'.

   If your package is intended as an XEmacs package or to accompany a
precompiled version of Emacs, you might not know which TeX system will
be available when preview-latex gets used.  In this case you should
build using the '--without-texmf-dir' option described previously.  This
can also be convenient for systems that are intended to support more
than a single TeX distribution.  Since more often than not TeX packages
for operating system distributions are either much more outdated or much
less complete than separately provided systems like TeX Live, this
method may be generally preferable when providing packages.

   The following package structure would be adequate for a typical fully
supported Unix-like installation:

'preview-tetex'
     Style files and documentation for 'preview.sty', placed into a TeX
     tree where it is accessible from the teTeX executables usually
     delivered with a system.  If there are other commonly used TeX
     system packages, it might be appropriate to provide separate
     packages for those.
'auctex-emacs-tetex'
     This package will require the installation of 'preview-tetex' and
     will record in 'TeX-macro-global' where to find the TeX tree.  It
     is also a good idea to run
          emacs -batch -f TeX-auto-generate-global
     when either AUCTeX or teTeX get installed or upgraded.  If your
     users might want to work with a different TeX distribution
     (nowadays pretty common), instead consider the following:
'auctex-emacs'
     This package will be compiled with '--without-texmf-dir' and will
     consequently contain the 'preview' style files in its private
     directory.  It will probably not be possible to initialize
     'TeX-macro-global' to a sensible value, so running
     'TeX-auto-generate-global' does not appear useful.  This package
     would neither conflict with nor provide 'preview-tetex'.
'auctex-xemacs-tetex'
'auctex-xemacs'
     Those are the obvious XEmacs equivalents.  For XEmacs, there is the
     additional problem that the XEmacs sumo package tree already
     possibly provides its own version of AUCTeX, and the user might
     even have used the XEmacs package manager to updating this package,
     or even installing a private AUCTeX version.  So you should make
     sure that such a package will not conflict with existing XEmacs
     packages and will be at an appropriate place in the load order
     (after site-wide and user-specific locations, but before a
     distribution-specific sumo package tree).  Using the
     '--without-packagedir' option might be one idea to avoid conflicts.
     Another might be to refrain from providing an XEmacs package and
     just rely on the user or system administrator to instead use the
     XEmacs package system.

1.2.6 Installation for non-privileged users
-------------------------------------------

Often people without system administration privileges want to install
software for their private use.  In that case you need to pass more
options to the 'configure' script.  For XEmacs users, this is fairly
easy, because the XEmacs package system has been designed to make this
sort of thing practical: but GNU Emacs users (and XEmacs users for whom
the package system is for some reason misbehaving) may need to do a
little more work.

   The main expedient is using the '--prefix' option to the 'configure'
script, and let it point to the personal home directory.  In that way,
resulting binaries will be installed under the 'bin' subdirectory of
your home directory, manual pages under 'man' and so on.  It is
reasonably easy to maintain a bunch of personal software, since the
prefix argument is supported by most 'configure' scripts.

   You'll have to add something like
'/home/myself/share/emacs/site-lisp' to your 'load-path' variable, if it
isn't there already.

   XEmacs users can achieve the same end by pointing 'configure' at an
appropriate package directory (normally
'--with-packagedir=~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages' will serve).  The package
directory stands a good chance at being detected automatically as long
as it is in a subtree of the specified PREFIX.

   Now here is another thing to ponder: perhaps you want to make it easy
for other users to share parts of your personal Emacs configuration.  In
general, you can do this by writing '~myself/' anywhere where you
specify paths to something installed in your personal subdirectories,
not merely '~/', since the latter, when used by other users, will point
to non-existent files.

   For yourself, it will do to manipulate environment variables in your
'.profile' resp. '.login' files.  But if people will be copying just
Elisp files, their copies will not work.  While it would in general be
preferable if the added components where available from a shell level,
too (like when you call the standalone info reader, or try using
'preview.sty' for functionality besides of Emacs previews), it will be a
big help already if things work from inside of Emacs.

   Here is how to do the various parts:

Making the Elisp available
--------------------------

In GNU Emacs, it should be sufficient if people just do

     (load "~myself/share/emacs/site-lisp/auctex.el" nil t t)
     (load "~myself/share/emacs/site-lisp/preview-latex.el" nil t t)

   where the path points to your personal installation.  The rest of the
package should be found relative from there without further ado.

   In XEmacs, you should ask the other users to add symbolic links in
the subdirectories 'lisp', 'info' and 'etc' of their
'~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/' directory.  (Alas, there is presently no
easy programmatic way to do this, except to have a script do the
symlinking for them.)

Making the Info files available
-------------------------------

For making the info files accessible from within Elisp, something like
the following might be convenient to add into your or other people's
startup files:

     (eval-after-load 'info
        '(add-to-list 'Info-directory-list "~myself/info"))

   In XEmacs, as long as XEmacs can see the package, there should be no
need to do anything at all; the info files should be immediately
visible.  However, you might want to set 'INFOPATH' anyway, for the sake
of standalone readers outside of XEmacs.  (The info files in XEmacs are
normally in '~/.xemacs/xemacs-packages/info'.)

Making the LaTeX style available
--------------------------------

If you want others to be able to share your installation, you should
configure it using '--without-texmf-dir', in which case things should
work as well for them as for you.

1.2.7 Installation under MS Windows
-----------------------------------

In a Nutshell
-------------

The following are brief installation instructions for the impatient.  In
case you don't understand some of this, run into trouble of some sort,
or need more elaborate information, refer to the detailed instructions
further below.

  1. Install the prerequisites, i.e.  Emacs or XEmacs, MSYS or Cygwin, a
     TeX system, and Ghostscript.

  2. Open the MSYS shell or a Cygwin shell and change to the directory
     containing the unzipped file contents.

  3. Configure AUCTeX:

     For Emacs: Many people like to install AUCTeX into the pseudo file
     system hierarchy set up by the Emacs installation.  Assuming Emacs
     is installed in 'C:/Program Files/Emacs' and the directory for
     local additions of your TeX system, e.g.  MiKTeX, is
     'C:/localtexmf', you can do this by typing the following statement
     at the shell prompt:

          ./configure --prefix='C:/Program Files/Emacs' \
            --infodir='C:/Program Files/Emacs/info' \
            --with-texmf-dir='C:/localtexmf'

     For XEmacs: You can install AUCTeX as an XEmacs package.  Assuming
     XEmacs is installed in 'C:/Program Files/XEmacs' and the directory
     for local additions of your TeX system, e.g.  MiKTeX, is
     'C:/localtexmf', you can do this by typing the following command at
     the shell prompt:

          ./configure --with-xemacs='C:/Program Files/XEmacs/bin/xemacs' \
            --with-texmf-dir='C:/localtexmf'

     The commands above are examples for common usage.  More on
     configuration options can be found in the detailed installation
     instructions below.

     If the configuration script failed to find all required programs,
     make sure that these programs are in your system path and add
     directories containing the programs to the 'PATH' environment
     variable if necessary.  Here is how to do that in W2000/XP:

       1. On the desktop, right click "My Computer" and select
          properties.
       2. Click on "Advanced" in the "System Properties" window.
       3. Select "Environment Variables".
       4. Select "path" in "System Variables" and click "edit".  Move to
          the front in the line (this might require scrolling) and add
          the missing path including drive letter, ended with a
          semicolon.

  4. If there were no further error messages, type

          make

     In case there were, please refer to the detailed description below.

  5. Finish the installation by typing

          make install

Detailed Installation Instructions
----------------------------------

Installation of AUCTeX under Windows is in itself not more complicated
than on other platforms.  However, meeting the prerequisites might
require more work than on some other platforms, and feel less natural.

   If you are experiencing any problems, even if you think they are of
your own making, be sure to report them to <auctex-devel@gnu.org> so
that we can explain things better in future.

   Windows is a problematic platform for installation scripts.  The main
problem is that the installation procedure requires consistent file
names in order to find its way in the directory hierarchy, and Windows
path names are a mess.

   The installation procedure tries finding stuff in system search paths
and in Emacs paths.  For that to succeed, you have to use the same
syntax and spelling and case of paths everywhere: in your system search
paths, in Emacs' 'load-path' variable, as argument to the scripts.  If
your path names contain spaces or other 'shell-unfriendly' characters,
most notably backslashes for directory separators, place the whole path
in '"double quote marks"' whenever you specify it on a command line.

   Avoid 'helpful' magic file names like '/cygdrive/c' and
'C:\PROGRA~1\' like the plague.  It is quite unlikely that the scripts
will be able to identify the actual file names involved.  Use the full
paths, making use of normal Windows drive letters like ' 'C:/Program
Files/Emacs' ' where required, and using the same combination of upper-
and lowercase letters as in the actual files.  File names containing
shell-special characters like spaces or backslashes (if you prefer that
syntax) need to get properly quoted to the shell: the above example used
single quotes for that.

   Ok, now here are the steps to perform:

  1. You need to unpack the AUCTeX distribution (which you seemingly
     have done since you are reading this).  It must be unpacked in a
     separate installation directory outside of your Emacs file
     hierarchy: the installation will later copy all necessary files to
     their final destination, and you can ultimately remove the
     directory where you unpacked the files.

     Line endings are a problem under Windows.  The distribution
     contains only text files, and theoretically most of the involved
     tools should get along with that.  However, the files are processed
     by various utilities, and it is conceivable that not all of them
     will use the same line ending conventions.  If you encounter
     problems, it might help if you try unpacking (or checking out) the
     files in binary mode, if your tools allow that.

     If you don't have a suitable unpacking tool, skip to the next step:
     this should provide you with a working 'unzip' command.

  2. The installation of AUCTeX will require the MSYS tool set from
     <http://www.mingw.org/> or the Cygwin tool set from
     <http://cygwin.com/>.  The latter is slower and larger (the
     download size of the base system is about 15 MB) but comes with a
     package manager that allows for updating the tool set and
     installing additional packages like, for example, the spell checker
     aspell.

     If Cygwin specific paths like '/cygdrive/c' crop up in the course
     of the installation, using a non-Cygwin Emacs could conceivably
     cause trouble.  Using Cygwin either for everything or nothing might
     save headaches, _if_ things don't work out.

  3. Install a current version of XEmacs from <http://www.xemacs.org/>
     or Emacs from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/>.  Emacs is the
     recommended choice because it is currently the primary platform for
     AUCTeX development.

  4. You need a working TeX installation.  One popular installation
     under Windows is MiKTeX (http://www.miktex.org).  Another much more
     extensive system is TeX Live (http://www.tug.org/texlive) which is
     rather close to its Unix cousins.

  5. A working copy of Ghostscript (http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/) is
     required for preview-latex operation.  Examining the output from
          gswin32c -h
     on a Windows command line should tell you whether your Ghostscript
     supports the 'png16m' device needed for PNG support.  MiKTeX
     apparently comes with its own Ghostscript called 'mgs.exe'.

  6. Perl (http://www.perl.org) is needed for rebuilding the
     documentation if you are working with a copy from Git or have
     touched documentation source files in the preview-latex part.  If
     the line endings of the file 'preview/latex/preview.dtx' don't
     correspond with what Perl calls '\n' when reading text files,
     you'll run into trouble.

  7. Now the fun stuff starts.  If you have not yet done so, unpack the
     AUCTeX distribution into a separate directory after rereading the
     instructions for unpacking above.

  8. Ready for takeoff.  Start some shell (typically 'bash') capable of
     running 'configure', change into the installation directory and
     call './configure' with appropriate options.

     Typical options you'll want to specify will be
     '--prefix=DRIVE:/PATH/TO/EMACS-HIERARCHY'
          which tells 'configure' where to perform the installation.  It
          may also make 'configure' find Emacs or XEmacs automatically;
          if this doesn't happen, try one of '--with-emacs' or
          '--with-xemacs' as described below.  All automatic detection
          of files and directories restricts itself to directories below
          the PREFIX or in the same hierarchy as the program accessing
          the files.  Usually, directories like 'man', 'share' and 'bin'
          will be situated right under PREFIX.

          This option also affects the defaults for placing the Texinfo
          documentation files (see also '--infodir' below) and
          automatically generated style hooks.

          If you have a central directory hierarchy (not untypical with
          Cygwin) for such stuff, you might want to specify its root
          here.  You stand a good chance that this will be the only
          option you need to supply, as long as your TeX-related
          executables are in your system path, which they better be for
          AUCTeX's operation, anyway.

     '--with-emacs'
          if you are installing for a version of Emacs.  You can use
          '--with-emacs=DRIVE:/PATH/TO/EMACS' to specify the name of the
          installed Emacs executable, complete with its path if
          necessary (if Emacs is not within a directory specified in
          your 'PATH' environment setting).

     '--with-xemacs'
          if you are installing for a version of XEmacs.  Again, you can
          use '--with-xemacs=DRIVE:/PATH/TO/XEMACS' to specify the name
          of the installed XEmacs executable complete with its path if
          necessary.  It may also be necessary to specify this option if
          a copy of Emacs is found in your 'PATH' environment setting,
          but you still would like to install a copy of AUCTeX for
          XEmacs.

     '--with-packagedir=DRIVE:/DIR'
          is an XEmacs-only option giving the location of the package
          directory.  This will install and activate the package.  Emacs
          uses a different installation scheme:

     '--with-lispdir=DRIVE:/PATH/TO/SITE-LISP'
          This Emacs-only option tells a place in 'load-path' below
          which the files are situated.  The startup files 'auctex.el'
          and 'preview-latex.el' will get installed here unless a
          subdirectory 'site-start.d' exists which will then be used
          instead.  The other files from AUCTeX will be installed in a
          subdirectory called 'auctex'.

          If you think that you need a different setup, please refer to
          the full installation instructions in *note Configure::.

     '--infodir=DRIVE:/PATH/TO/INFO/DIRECTORY'
          If you are installing into an Emacs directory, info files have
          to be put into the 'info' folder below that directory.  The
          configuration script will usually try to install into the
          folder 'share/info', so you have to override this by
          specifying something like '--infodir='C:/Program Files/info''
          for the configure call.

     '--with-auto-dir=DRIVE:/DIR'
          Directory containing automatically generated information.  You
          should not normally need to set this, as '--prefix' should
          take care of this.

     '--disable-preview'
          Use this option if your Emacs version is unable to support
          image display.  This will be the case if you are using a
          native variant of Emacs 21.

     '--with-texmf-dir=DRIVE:/DIR'
          This will specify the directory where your TeX installation
          sits.  If your TeX installation does not conform to the TDS
          (TeX directory standard), you may need to specify more options
          to get everything in place.

     For more information about any of the above and additional options,
     see *note Configure::.

     Calling './configure --help=recursive' will tell about other
     options, but those are almost never required.

     Some executables might not be found in your path.  That is not a
     good idea, but you can get around by specifying environment
     variables to 'configure':
          GS="DRIVE:/PATH/TO/GSWIN32C.EXE" ./configure ...
     should work for this purpose.  'gswin32c.exe' is the usual name for
     the required _command line_ executable under Windows; in contrast,
     'gswin32.exe' is likely to fail.

     As an alternative to specifying variables for the 'configure' call
     you can add directories containing the required executables to the
     'PATH' variable of your Windows system.  This is especially a good
     idea if Emacs has trouble finding the respective programs later
     during normal operation.

  9. Run 'make' in the installation directory.

  10. Run 'make install' in the installation directory.

  11. With XEmacs, AUCTeX and preview-latex should now be active by
     default.  With Emacs, activation depends on a working
     'site-start.d' directory or similar setup, since then the startup
     files 'auctex.el' and 'preview-latex.el' will have been placed
     there.  If this has not been done, you should be able to load the
     startup files manually with
          (load "auctex.el" nil t t)
          (load "preview-latex.el" nil t t)
     in either a site-wide 'site-start.el' or your personal startup file
     (usually accessible as '~/.emacs' from within Emacs and
     '~/.xemacs/init.el' from within XEmacs).

     The default configuration of AUCTeX is probably not the best fit
     for Windows systems with MiKTeX.  You might want to add
          (require 'tex-mik)
     after loading 'auctex.el' and 'preview-latex.el' in order to get
     more appropriate values for some customization options.

     You can always use

          M-x customize-group RET AUCTeX RET

     in order to customize more stuff, or use the 'Customize' menu.

  12. Load 'preview/circ.tex' into Emacs or XEmacs and see if you get
     the 'Command' menu.  Try using it to LaTeX the file.

  13. Check whether the 'Preview' menu is available in this file.  Use
     it to generate previews for the document.

     If this barfs and tells you that image type 'png' is not supported,
     you can either add PNG support to your Emacs installation or choose
     another image format to be used by preview-latex.

     Adding support for an image format usually involves the
     installation of a library, e.g.  from <http://gnuwin32.sf.net/>.
     If you got your Emacs from <gnu.org> you might want to check its
     README file (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/README) for
     details.

     A different image format can be chosen by setting the variable
     'preview-image-type'.  While it is recommended to keep the 'dvipng'
     or 'png' setting, you can temporarily select a different format
     like 'pnm' to check if the lack of PNG support is the only problem
     with your Emacs installation.

     Try adding the line

          (setq preview-image-type 'pnm)

     to your init file for a quick test.  You should remove the line
     after the test again, because PNM files take away *vast* amounts of
     disk space, and thus also of load/save time.

   Well, that about is all.  Have fun!

1.2.8 Customizing
-----------------

Most of the site-specific customization should already have happened
during configuration of AUCTeX.  Any further customization can be done
with customization buffers directly in Emacs.  Just type 'M-x
customize-group RET AUCTeX RET' to open the customization group for
AUCTeX or use the menu entries provided in the mode menus.  Editing the
file 'tex-site.el' as suggested in former versions of AUCTeX should not
be done anymore because the installation routine will overwrite those
changes.

   You might check some variables with a special significance.  They are
accessible directly by typing 'M-x customize-variable RET <variable>
RET'.

 -- User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

   Normally, AUCTeX will only allow you to complete macros and
environments which are built-in, specified in AUCTeX style files or
defined by yourself.  If you issue the 'M-x TeX-auto-generate-global'
command after loading AUCTeX, you will be able to complete on all macros
available in the standard style files used by your document.  To do
this, you must set this variable to a list of directories where the
standard style files are located.  The directories will be searched
recursively, so there is no reason to list subdirectories explicitly.
Automatic configuration will already have set the variable for you if it
could use the program 'kpsewhich'.  In this case you normally don't have
to alter anything.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Quick Start,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Introduction

1.3 Quick Start
===============

AUCTeX is a powerful program offering many features and configuration
options.  If you are new to AUCTeX this might be deterrent.  Fortunately
you do not have to learn everything at once.  This Quick Start Guide
will give you the knowledge of the most important commands and enable
you to prepare your first LaTeX document with AUCTeX after only a few
minutes of reading.

   In this introduction, we assume that AUCTeX is already installed on
your system.  If this is not the case, you should read the file
'INSTALL' in the base directory of the unpacked distribution tarball.
These installation instructions are available in this manual as well,
*note Installation::.  We also assume that you are familiar with the way
keystrokes are written in Emacs manuals.  If not, have a look at the
Emacs Tutorial in the Help menu.

   If AUCTeX is installed, you might still need to activate it, by
inserting

     (load "auctex.el" nil t t)

   in your user init file.(1)  If you've installed AUCTeX from the Emacs
package manager (ELPA), you must not have this line in your user init
file.  The installation procedure already cares about loading AUCTeX
correctly.

   In order to get support for many of the LaTeX packages you will use
in your documents, you should enable document parsing as well, which can
be achieved by putting

     (setq TeX-auto-save t)
     (setq TeX-parse-self t)

   into your init file.  Finally, if you often use '\include' or
'\input', you should make AUCTeX aware of the multi-file document
structure.  You can do this by inserting

     (setq-default TeX-master nil)

   into your init file.  Each time you open a new file, AUCTeX will then
ask you for a master file.

1.3.1 Functions for editing TeX files
-------------------------------------

1.3.1.1 Making your TeX code more readable
..........................................

AUCTeX can do syntax highlighting of your source code, that means
commands will get special colors or fonts.  You can enable it locally by
typing 'M-x font-lock-mode RET'.  If you want to have font locking
activated generally, enable 'global-font-lock-mode', e.g.  with 'M-x
customize-variable RET global-font-lock-mode RET'.

   AUCTeX will indent new lines to indicate their syntactical
relationship to the surrounding text.  For example, the text of a
'\footnote' or text inside of an environment will be indented relative
to the text around it.  If the indenting has gotten wrong after adding
or deleting some characters, use <TAB> to reindent the line, 'M-q' for
the whole paragraph, or 'M-x LaTeX-fill-buffer RET' for the whole
buffer.

1.3.1.2 Entering sectioning commands
....................................

Insertion of sectioning macros, that is '\chapter', '\section',
'\subsection', etc.  and accompanying '\label' commands may be eased by
using 'C-c C-s'.  You will be asked for the section level.  As nearly
everywhere in AUCTeX, you can use the <TAB> or <SPC> key to get a list
of available level names, and to auto-complete what you started typing.
Next, you will be asked for the printed title of the section, and last
you will be asked for a label to be associated with the section.

1.3.1.3 Inserting environments
..............................

Similarly, you can insert environments, that is '\begin{}'-'\end{}'
pairs: Type 'C-c C-e', and select an environment type.  Again, you can
use <TAB> or <SPC> to get a list, and to complete what you type.
Actually, the list will not only provide standard LaTeX environments,
but also take your '\documentclass' and '\usepackage' commands into
account if you have parsing enabled by setting 'TeX-parse-self' to 't'.
If you use a couple of environments frequently, you can use the up and
down arrow keys (or 'M-p' and 'M-n') in the minibuffer to get back to
the previously inserted commands.

   Some environments need additional arguments.  Often, AUCTeX knows
about this and asks you to enter a value.

1.3.1.4 Inserting macros
........................

'C-c C-m', or simply 'C-c RET' will give you a prompt that asks you for
a LaTeX macro.  You can use <TAB> for completion, or the up/down arrow
keys (or 'M-p' and 'M-n') to browse the command history.  In many cases,
AUCTeX knows which arguments a macro needs and will ask you for that.
It even can differentiate between mandatory and optional arguments--for
details, see *note Completion::.

   An additional help for inserting macros is provided by the
possibility to complete macros right in the buffer.  With point at the
end of a partially written macro, you can complete it by typing 'M-TAB'.

1.3.1.5 Changing the font
.........................

AUCTeX provides convenient keyboard shortcuts for inserting macros which
specify the font to be used for typesetting certain parts of the text.
They start with 'C-c C-f', and the last 'C-' combination tells AUCTeX
which font you want:

'C-c C-f C-b'
     Insert bold face '\textbf{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-i'
     Insert italics '\textit{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-e'
     Insert emphasized '\emph{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-s'
     Insert slanted '\textsl{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-r'
     Insert roman \textrm{-!-} text.

'C-c C-f C-f'
     Insert sans serif '\textsf{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-t'
     Insert typewriter '\texttt{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-c'
     Insert SMALL CAPS '\textsc{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-d'
     Delete the innermost font specification containing point.

   If you want to change font attributes of existing text, mark it as a
region, and then invoke the commands.  If no region is selected, the
command will be inserted with empty braces, and you can start typing the
changed text.

   Most of those commands will also work in math mode, but then macros
like '\mathbf' will be inserted.

1.3.1.6 Other useful features
.............................

AUCTeX also tries to help you when inserting the right "quote" signs for
your language, dollar signs to typeset math, or pairs of braces.  It
offers shortcuts for commenting out text ('C-c ;' for the current region
or 'C-c %' for the paragraph you are in).  The same keystrokes will
remove the % signs, if the region or paragraph is commented out yet.
With 'TeX-fold-mode', you can hide certain parts (like footnotes,
references etc.)  that you do not edit currently.  Support for Emacs'
outline mode is provided as well.  And there's more, but this is beyond
the scope of this Quick Start Guide.

1.3.2 Creating and viewing output, debugging
--------------------------------------------

1.3.2.1 One Command for LaTeX, helpers, viewers, and printing
.............................................................

If you have typed some text and want to run LaTeX (or TeX, or other
programs--see below) on it, type 'C-c C-c'.  If applicable, you will be
asked whether you want to save changes, and which program you want to
invoke.  In many cases, the choice that AUCTeX suggests will be just
what you want: first 'latex', then a viewer.  If a 'latex' run produces
or changes input files for 'makeindex', the next suggestion will be to
run that program, and AUCTeX knows that you need to run 'latex' again
afterwards--the same holds for BibTeX.

   When no processor invocation is necessary anymore, AUCTeX will
suggest to run a viewer, or you can chose to create a PostScript file
using 'dvips', or to directly print it.

   At this place, a warning needs to be given: First, although AUCTeX is
really good in detecting the standard situations when an additional
'latex' run is necessary, it cannot detect it always.  Second, the
creation of PostScript files or direct printing currently only works
when your output file is a DVI file, not a PDF file.

   Ah, you didn't know you can do both?  That brings us to the next
topic.

1.3.2.2 Choosing an output format
.................................

From a LaTeX file, you can produce DVI output, or a PDF file directly
via 'pdflatex'.  You can switch on source specials for easier navigation
in the output file, or tell 'latex' to stop after an error (usually
'\noninteractive' is used, to allow you to detect all errors in a single
run).

   These options are controlled by toggles, the keystrokes should be
easy to memorize:

'C-c C-t C-p'
     This command toggles between DVI and PDF output

'C-c C-t C-i'
     toggles interactive mode

'C-c C-t C-s'
     toggles source specials support

'C-c C-t C-o'
     toggles usage of Omega/lambda.

1.3.2.3 Debugging LaTeX
.......................

When AUCTeX runs a program, it creates an output buffer in which it
displays the output of the command.  If there is a syntactical error in
your file, 'latex' will not complete successfully.  AUCTeX will tell you
that, and you can get to the place where the first error occured by
pressing 'C-c `' (the last character is a backtick).  The view will be
split in two windows, the output will be displayed in the lower buffer,
and both buffers will be centered around the place where the error
ocurred.  You can then try to fix it in the document buffer, and use the
same keystrokes to get to the next error.  This procedure may be
repeated until all errors have been dealt with.  By pressing 'C-c C-w'
('TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') you can toggle whether AUCTeX should notify
you of overfull and underfull boxes in addition to regular errors.

   If a command got stuck in a seemingly infinite loop, or you want to
stop execution for other reasons, you can use 'C-c C-k' (for "kill").
Similar to 'C-l', which centers the buffer you are in around your
current position, 'C-c C-l' centers the output buffer so that the last
lines added at the bottom become visible.

1.3.2.4 Running LaTeX on parts of your document
...............................................

If you want to check how some part of your text looks like, and do not
want to wait until the whole document has been typeset, then mark it as
a region and use 'C-c C-r'.  It behaves just like 'C-c C-c', but it only
uses the document preamble and the region you marked.

   If you are using '\include' or '\input' to structure your document,
try 'C-c C-b' while you are editing one of the included files.  It will
run 'latex' only on the current buffer, using the preamble from the
master file.

2 Editing the Document Source
*****************************

The most commonly used commands/macros of AUCTeX are those which simply
insert templates for often used TeX, LaTeX, or ConTeXt constructs, like
font changes, handling of environments, etc.  These features are very
simple, and easy to learn, and help you avoid mistakes like mismatched
braces, or '\begin{}'-'\end{}' pairs.

   Apart from that this chapter contains a description of some features
for entering more specialized sorts of text, for formatting the source
by indenting and filling and for navigating through the document.

2.1 Insertion of Quotes, Dollars, and Braces
============================================

Quotation Marks
---------------

In TeX, literal double quotes '"like this"' are seldom used, instead two
single quotes are used '``like this'''.  To help you insert these
efficiently, AUCTeX allows you to continue to press '"' to insert two
single quotes.  To get a literal double quote, press '"' twice.

 -- Command: TeX-insert-quote COUNT
     ('"') Insert the appropriate quote marks for TeX.

     Inserts the value of 'TeX-open-quote' (normally '``') or
     'TeX-close-quote' (normally '''') depending on the context.  With
     prefix argument, always inserts '"' characters.

 -- User Option: TeX-open-quote
     String inserted by typing '"' to open a quotation.  (*Note
     European::, for language-specific quotation mark insertion.)

 -- User Option: TeX-close-quote
     String inserted by typing '"' to close a quotation.  (*Note
     European::, for language-specific quotation mark insertion.)

 -- User Option: TeX-quote-after-quote
     Determines the behavior of '"'.  If it is non-nil, typing '"' will
     insert a literal double quote.  The respective values of
     'TeX-open-quote' and 'TeX-close-quote' will be inserted after
     typing '"' once again.

   The 'babel' package provides special support for the requirements of
typesetting quotation marks in many different languages.  If you use
this package, either directly or by loading a language-specific style
file, you should also use the special commands for quote insertion
instead of the standard quotes shown above.  AUCTeX is able to recognize
several of these languages and will change quote insertion accordingly.
*Note European::, for details about this feature and how to control it.

   In case you are using the 'csquotes' package, you should customize
'LaTeX-csquotes-open-quote', 'LaTeX-csquotes-close-quote' and
'LaTeX-csquotes-quote-after-quote'.  The quotation characters will only
be used if both variables--'LaTeX-csquotes-open-quote' and
'LaTeX-csquotes-close-quote'--are non-empty strings.  But then the
'csquotes'-related values will take precedence over the
language-specific ones.

Dollar Signs
------------

In AUCTeX, dollar signs should match like they do in TeX.  This has been
partially implemented, we assume dollar signs always match within a
paragraph.  By default, the first '$' you insert in a paragraph will do
nothing special.  The second '$' will match the first.  This will be
indicated by moving the cursor temporarily over the first dollar sign.

 -- Command: TeX-insert-dollar ARG
     ('$') Insert dollar sign.

     Show matching dollar sign if this dollar sign end the TeX math
     mode.

     With optional ARG, insert that many dollar signs.

   TeX and LaTeX users often look for a way to insert inline equations
like '$...$' or '\(...\)' simply typing '$'.  AUCTeX helps them through
the customizable variable 'TeX-electric-math'.

 -- User Option: TeX-electric-math
     If the variable is non-nil and you type '$' outside math mode,
     AUCTeX will automatically insert the opening and closing symbols
     for an inline equation and put the point between them.  The opening
     symbol will blink when 'blink-matching-paren' is non-nil.  If
     'TeX-electric-math' is nil, typing '$' simply inserts '$' at point,
     this is the default.

     Besides 'nil', possible values for this variable are '(cons "$"
     "$")' for TeX inline equations '$...$', and '(cons "\\(" "\\)")'
     for LaTeX inline equations '\(...\)'.

     If the variable is non-nil and point is inside math mode right
     between a couple of single dollars, pressing '$' will insert
     another pair of dollar signs and leave the point between them.
     Thus, if 'TeX-electric-math' is set to '(cons "$" "$")' you can
     easily obtain a TeX display equation '$$...$$' by pressing '$'
     twice in a row.  (Note that you should not use double dollar signs
     in LaTeX because this practice can lead to wrong spacing in typeset
     documents.)

     In addition, when the variable is non-nil and there is an active
     region outside math mode, typing '$' will put around the active
     region symbols for opening and closing inline equation and keep the
     region active, leaving point after the closing symbol.  By pressing
     repeatedly '$' while the region is active you can toggle between an
     inline equation, a display equation, and no equation.  To be
     precise, '$...$' is replaced by '$$...$$', whereas '\(...\)' is
     replaced by '\[...\]'.

   If you want to automatically insert '$...$' in plain TeX files, and
'\(...\)' in LaTeX files by pressing '$', add the following to your init
file
     (add-hook 'plain-TeX-mode-hook
     	  (lambda () (set (make-variable-buffer-local 'TeX-electric-math)
     			  (cons "$" "$"))))
     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook
     	  (lambda () (set (make-variable-buffer-local 'TeX-electric-math)
     			  (cons "\\(" "\\)"))))

Braces
------

To avoid unbalanced braces, it is useful to insert them pairwise.  You
can do this by typing 'C-c {'.

 -- Command: TeX-insert-braces
     ('C-c {') Make a pair of braces and position the cursor to type
     inside of them.  If there is an active region, put braces around it
     and leave point after the closing brace.

   When writing complex math formulas in LaTeX documents, you sometimes
need to adjust the size of braces with pairs of macros like
'\left'-'\right', '\bigl'-'\bigr' and so on.  You can avoid unbalanced
pairs with the help of 'TeX-insert-macro', bound to 'C-c C-m' or 'C-c
<RET>' (*note Completion::).  If you insert left size adjusting macros
such as '\left', '\bigl' etc.  with 'TeX-insert-macro', it asks for left
brace to use and supplies automatically right size adjusting macros such
as '\right', '\bigr' etc.  and corresponding right brace in addtion to
the intended left macro and left brace.

   The completion by 'TeX-insert-macro' also applies when entering
macros such as '\langle', '\lfloor' and '\lceil', which produce the left
part of the paired braces.  For example, inserting '\lfloor' by 'C-c
C-m' is immediately followed by the insertion of '\rfloor'.  In
addition, if the point was located just after '\left' or its friends,
the corresponding '\right' etc.  will be inserted in front of '\rfloor'.
In both cases, active region is honored.

   As a side effect, when 'LaTeX-math-mode' (*note Mathematics::) is on,
just typing '`(' inserts not only '\langle', but also '\rangle'.

   If you do not like such auto completion at all, it can be disabled by
a user option.

 -- User Option: TeX-arg-right-insert-p
     If this option is turned off, the automatic supply of the right
     macros and braces is suppressed.

   When you edit LaTeX documents, you can enable automatic brace pairing
when typing '(', '{' and '['.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace
     If this option is on, just typing '(', '{' or '[' immediately adds
     the corresponding right brace ')', '}' or ']'.  The point is left
     after the opening brace.  If there is an active region, braces are
     put around it.

     They recognize the preceeding backslash or size adjusting macros
     such as '\left', '\bigl' etc., so the following completions will
     occur:

        * (when typing single left brace)

             - '(' -> '()'

             - '{' -> '{}'

             - '[' -> '[]'

        * (when typing left brace just after a backslash)

             - '\(' -> '\(\)'

             - '\{' -> '\{\}'

             - '\[' -> '\[\]'

        * (when typing just after '\left' or '\bigl')

             - '\left(' -> '\left(\right)'

             - '\bigl[' -> '\bigl[\bigr]'

        * (when typing just after '\Bigl\')

             - '\Bigl\{' -> '\Bigl\{\Bigr\}'

     This auto completion feature may be a bit annoying when editing an
     already existing LaTeX document.  In that case, use 'C-u 1' or
     'C-q' before typing '(', '{' or '['.  Then no completion is done
     and just a single left brace is inserted.  In fact, with optional
     prefix ARG, just that many open braces are inserted without any
     completion.

2.2 Inserting Font Specifiers
=============================

Perhaps the most used keyboard commands of AUCTeX are the short-cuts
available for easy insertion of font changing macros.

   If you give an argument (that is, type 'C-u') to the font command,
the innermost font will be replaced, i.e.  the font in the TeX group
around point will be changed.  The following table shows the available
commands, with '-!-' indicating the position where the text will be
inserted.

'C-c C-f C-b'
     Insert bold face '\textbf{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-i'
     Insert italics '\textit{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-e'
     Insert emphasized '\emph{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-s'
     Insert slanted '\textsl{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-r'
     Insert roman \textrm{-!-} text.

'C-c C-f C-f'
     Insert sans serif '\textsf{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-t'
     Insert typewriter '\texttt{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-c'
     Insert SMALL CAPS '\textsc{-!-}' text.

'C-c C-f C-d'
     Delete the innermost font specification containing point.

 -- Command: TeX-font replace what
     ('C-c C-f') Insert template for font change command.

     If REPLACE is not nil, replace current font.  WHAT determines the
     font to use, as specified by 'TeX-font-list'.

 -- User Option: TeX-font-list
     List of fonts used by 'TeX-font'.

     Each entry is a list with three elements.  The first element is the
     key to activate the font.  The second element is the string to
     insert before point, and the third element is the string to insert
     after point.  An optional fourth element means always replace if
     not nil.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-font-list
     List of fonts used by 'TeX-font' in LaTeX mode.  It has the same
     structure as 'TeX-font-list'.

2.3 Inserting chapters, sections, etc.
======================================

Insertion of sectioning macros, that is '\chapter', '\section',
'\subsection', etc.  and accompanying '\label''s may be eased by using
'C-c C-s'.  This command is highly customizable, the following describes
the default behavior.

   When invoking you will be asked for a section macro to insert.  An
appropriate default is automatically selected by AUCTeX, that is either:
at the top of the document; the top level sectioning for that document
style, and any other place: The same as the last occurring sectioning
command.

   Next, you will be asked for the actual name of that section, and last
you will be asked for a label to be associated with that section.  The
label will be prefixed by the value specified in 'LaTeX-section-hook'.

 -- Command: LaTeX-section ARG
     ('C-c C-s') Insert a sectioning command.

     Determine the type of section to be inserted, by the argument ARG.

        * If ARG is nil or missing, use the current level.
        * If ARG is a list (selected by C-u), go downward one level.
        * If ARG is negative, go up that many levels.
        * If ARG is positive or zero, use absolute level:
             + 0 : part
             + 1 : chapter
             + 2 : section
             + 3 : subsection
             + 4 : subsubsection
             + 5 : paragraph
             + 6 : subparagraph

     The following variables can be set to customize the function.

     'LaTeX-section-hook'
          Hooks to be run when inserting a section.
     'LaTeX-section-label'
          Prefix to all section references.

   The precise behavior of 'LaTeX-section' is defined by the contents of
'LaTeX-section-hook'.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-section-hook
     List of hooks to run when a new section is inserted.

     The following variables are set before the hooks are run

     LEVEL
          Numeric section level, default set by prefix arg to
          'LaTeX-section'.
     NAME
          Name of the sectioning command, derived from LEVEL.
     TITLE
          The title of the section, default to an empty string.
     TOC
          Entry for the table of contents list, default nil.
     DONE-MARK
          Position of point afterwards, default nil meaning after the
          inserted text.

     A number of hooks are already defined.  Most likely, you will be
     able to get the desired functionality by choosing from these hooks.

     'LaTeX-section-heading'
          Query the user about the name of the sectioning command.
          Modifies LEVEL and NAME.
     'LaTeX-section-title'
          Query the user about the title of the section.  Modifies
          TITLE.
     'LaTeX-section-toc'
          Query the user for the toc entry.  Modifies TOC.
     'LaTeX-section-section'
          Insert LaTeX section command according to NAME, TITLE, and
          TOC.  If TOC is nil, no toc entry is inserted.  If TOC or
          TITLE are empty strings, DONE-MARK will be placed at the point
          they should be inserted.
     'LaTeX-section-label'
          Insert a label after the section command.  Controlled by the
          variable 'LaTeX-section-label'.

     To get a full featured 'LaTeX-section' command, insert

          (setq LaTeX-section-hook
                '(LaTeX-section-heading
          	LaTeX-section-title
          	LaTeX-section-toc
          	LaTeX-section-section
          	LaTeX-section-label))

     in your '.emacs' file.

   The behavior of 'LaTeX-section-label' is determined by the variable
'LaTeX-section-label'.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-section-label
     Default prefix when asking for a label.

     If it is a string, it is used unchanged for all kinds of sections.
     If it is nil, no label is inserted.  If it is a list, the list is
     searched for a member whose car is equal to the name of the
     sectioning command being inserted.  The cdr is then used as the
     prefix.  If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil, no label
     is inserted.

     By default, chapters have a prefix of 'cha:' while sections and
     subsections have a prefix of 'sec:'.  Labels are not automatically
     inserted for other types of sections.

2.4 Inserting Environment Templates
===================================

A large apparatus is available that supports insertions of environments,
that is '\begin{}' -- '\end{}' pairs.

   AUCTeX is aware of most of the actual environments available in a
specific document.  This is achieved by examining your '\documentclass'
command, and consulting a precompiled list of environments available in
a large number of styles.

   Most of these are described further in the following sections, and
you may easily specify more.  *Note Customizing Environments::.

   You insert an environment with 'C-c C-e', and select an environment
type.  Depending on the environment, AUCTeX may ask more questions about
the optional parts of the selected environment type.  With 'C-u C-c C-e'
you will change the current environment.

 -- Command: LaTeX-environment ARG
     ('C-c C-e') AUCTeX will prompt you for an environment to insert.
     At this prompt, you may press <TAB> or <SPC> to complete a
     partially written name, and/or to get a list of available
     environments.  After selection of a specific environment AUCTeX may
     prompt you for further specifications.

     If the optional argument ARG is not-nil (i.e.  you have given a
     prefix argument), the current environment is modified and no new
     environment is inserted.

   AUCTeX helps you adding labels to environments which use them, such
as 'equation', 'figure', 'table', etc... When you insert one of the
supported environments with 'C-c C-e', you will be automatically
prompted for a label.  You can select the prefix to be used for such
environments with the 'LaTeX-label-alist' variable.
 -- User Option: LaTeX-label-alist
     List the prefixes to be used for the label of each supported
     environment.

     This is an alist whose car is the environment name, and the cdr
     either the prefix or a symbol referring to one.

     If the name is not found, or if the cdr is nil, no label is
     automatically inserted for that environment.

     If you want to automatically insert a label for a environment but
     with an empty prefix, use the empty string '""' as the cdr of the
     corresponding entry.

   As a default selection, AUCTeX will suggest the environment last
inserted or, as the first choice the value of the variable
'LaTeX-default-environment'.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-default-environment
     Default environment to insert when invoking 'LaTeX-environment'
     first time.  When the current environment is 'document', it is
     overriden by 'LaTeX-default-document-environment'.

 -- Variable: LaTeX-default-document-environment
     Default environment when invoking 'LaTeX-environment' and the
     current environment is 'document'.  It is intended to be used in
     LaTeX class style files.  For example, in 'beamer.el' it is set to
     'frame', in 'letter.el' to 'letter', and in 'slides.el' to 'slide'.

   If the document is empty, or the cursor is placed at the top of the
document, AUCTeX will default to insert a 'document' environment
prompting also for the insertion of '\documentclass' and '\usepackage'
macros.  You will be prompted for a new package until you enter nothing.
If you do not want to insert any '\usepackage' at all, just press <RET>
at the first 'Packages' prompt.

   AUCTeX distinguishes normal and expert environments.  By default, it
will offer completion only for normal environments.  This behavior is
controlled by the user option 'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

 -- User Option: TeX-complete-expert-commands
     Complete macros and environments marked as expert commands.

     Possible values are nil, t, or a list of style names.

     nil
          Don't complete expert commands (default).
     t
          Always complete expert commands.
     (STYLES ...)
          Only complete expert commands of STYLES.

 -- Command: LaTeX-close-environment
     ('C-c ]') Insert an '\end' that matches the current environment.

   AUCTeX offers keyboard shortcuts for moving point to the beginning
and to the end of the current environment.
 -- Command: LaTeX-find-matching-begin
     ('C-M-a') Move point to the '\begin' of the current environment.

     If this command is called inside a comment and
     'LaTeX-syntactic-comments' is enabled, try to find the environment
     in commented regions with the same comment prefix.

 -- Command: LaTeX-find-matching-end

2.4.1 Equations
---------------

When inserting equation-like environments, the '\label' will have a
default prefix, which is controlled by the following variables:

 -- User Option: LaTeX-equation-label
     Prefix to use for 'equation' labels.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-eqnarray-label
     Prefix to use for 'eqnarray' labels.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-amsmath-label
     Prefix to use for amsmath equation labels.  Amsmath equations
     include 'align', 'alignat', 'xalignat', 'aligned', 'flalign' and
     'gather'.

2.4.2 Floats
------------

Figures and tables (i.e., floats) may also be inserted using AUCTeX.
After choosing either 'figure' or 'table' in the environment list
described above, you will be prompted for a number of additional things.

FLOAT POSITION
     This is the optional argument of float environments that controls
     how they are placed in the final document.  In LaTeX this is a
     sequence of the letters 'htbp' as described in the LaTeX manual.
     The value will default to the value of 'LaTeX-float'.

CAPTION
     This is the caption of the float.  The default is to insert the
     caption at the bottom of the float.  You can specify floats where
     the caption should be placed at the top with
     'LaTeX-top-caption-list'.

LABEL
     The label of this float.  The label will have a default prefix,
     which is controlled by the variables 'LaTeX-figure-label' and
     'LaTeX-table-label'.

   Moreover, you will be asked if you want the contents of the float
environment to be horizontally centered.  Upon a positive answer a
'\centering' macro will be inserted at the beginning of the float
environment.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-float
     Default placement for floats.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-figure-label
     Prefix to use for figure labels.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-table-label
     Prefix to use for table labels.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-top-caption-list
     List of float environments with top caption.

2.4.3 Itemize-like Environments
-------------------------------

In an itemize-like environment, nodes (i.e., '\item's) may be inserted
using 'C-c <LFD>'.

 -- Command: LaTeX-insert-item
     ('C-c <LFD>') Close the current item, move to the next line and
     insert an appropriate '\item' for the current environment.  That
     is, 'itemize' and 'enumerate' will have '\item ' inserted, while
     'description' will have '\item[]' inserted.

 -- User Option: TeX-arg-item-label-p
     If non-nil, you will always be asked for optional label in items.
     Otherwise, you will be asked only in description environments.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Tabular-like,  Next: Customizing Environments,  Prev: Itemize-like,  Up: Environments

2.4.4 Tabular-like Environments
-------------------------------

When inserting Tabular-like environments, that is, 'tabular' 'array'
etc., you will be prompted for a template for that environment.  Related
variables:

 -- User Option: LaTeX-default-format
     Default format string for array and tabular environments.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-default-width
     Default width for minipage and tabular* environments.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-default-position
     Default position string for array and tabular environments.  If
     nil, act like the empty string is given, but don't prompt for a
     position.

   AUCTeX calculates the number of columns from the format string and
inserts the suitable number of ampersands.

   You can use 'C-c <LFD>' ('LaTeX-insert-item') to terminate rows in
these environments.  It supplies line break macro '\\' and inserts the
suitable number of ampersands on the next line.

 -- Command: LaTeX-insert-item
     ('C-c <LFD>') Close the current row with '\\', move to the next
     line and insert an appropriate number of ampersands for the current
     environment.

   Similar supports are provided for various amsmath environments such
as 'align', 'gather', 'alignat', 'matrix' etc.  Try typing 'C-c <LFD>'
in these environments.  It recognizes the current environment and does
the appropriate job depending on the context.

File: auctex.info,  Node: Mathematics,  Next: Completion,  Prev: Environments,  Up: Editing

2.5 Entering Mathematics
========================

TeX is written by a mathematician, and has always contained good support
for formatting mathematical text.  AUCTeX supports this tradition, by
offering a special minor mode for entering text with many mathematical
symbols.  You can enter this mode by typing 'C-c ~'.

 -- Command: LaTeX-math-mode
     ('C-c ~') Toggle LaTeX Math mode.  This is a minor mode rebinding
     the key 'LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix' to allow easy typing of
     mathematical symbols.  '`' will read a character from the keyboard,
     and insert the symbol as specified in 'LaTeX-math-default' and
     'LaTeX-math-list'.  If given a prefix argument, the symbol will be
     surrounded by dollar signs.

   You can use another prefix key (instead of '`') by setting the
variable 'LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix'.

   To enable LaTeX Math mode by default, add the following in your
'.emacs' file:
     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-math-mode)

 -- User Option: LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix
     A string containing the prefix of 'LaTeX-math-mode' commands; This
     value defaults to '`'.

     The string has to be a key or key sequence in a format understood
     by the 'kbd' macro.  This corresponds to the syntax usually used in
     the manuals for Emacs Emacs Lisp.

   The variable 'LaTeX-math-list' allows you to add your own mappings.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-math-list
     A list containing user-defined keys and commands to be used in
     LaTeX Math mode.  Each entry should be a list of two to four
     elements.

     First, the key to be used after 'LaTeX-math-abbrev-prefix' for
     macro insertion.  If it is nil, the symbol has no associated
     keystroke (it is available in the menu, though).

     Second, a string representing the name of the macro (without a
     leading backslash.)

     Third, a string representing the name of a submenu the command
     should be added to.  Use a list of strings in case of nested menus.

     Fourth, the position of a Unicode character to be displayed in the
     menu alongside the macro name.  This is an integer value.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-math-menu-unicode
     Whether the LaTeX menu should try using Unicode for effect.  Your
     Emacs built must be able to display include Unicode characters in
     menus for this feature.

   AUCTeX's reference card 'tex-ref.tex' includes a list of all math
mode commands.

   AUCTeX can help you write subscripts and superscripts in math
constructs by automatically inserting a pair of braces after typing <_>
or <^> respectively and putting point between the braces.  In order to
enable this feature, set the variable 'TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript'
to a non-nil value.

 -- User Option: TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript
     If non-nil, insert braces after typing <^> and <_> in math mode.

2.6 Completion
==============

Emacs lisp programmers probably know the 'lisp-complete-symbol' command,
usually bound to 'M-<TAB>'.  Users of the wonderful ispell mode know and
love the 'ispell-complete-word' command from that package.  Similarly,
AUCTeX has a 'TeX-complete-symbol' command, by default bound to
'M-<TAB>' which is equivalent to 'M-C-i'.  Using 'TeX-complete-symbol'
makes it easier to type and remember the names of long LaTeX macros.

   In order to use 'TeX-complete-symbol', you should write a backslash
and the start of the macro.  Typing 'M-<TAB>' will now complete as much
of the macro, as it unambiguously can.  For example, if you type
''\renewc'' and then 'M-<TAB>', it will expand to ''\renewcommand''.

 -- Command: TeX-complete-symbol
     ('M-<TAB>') Complete TeX symbol before point.

   A more direct way to insert a macro is with 'TeX-insert-macro', bound
to 'C-c C-m' which is equivalent to 'C-c <RET>'.  It has the advantage
over completion that it knows about the argument of most standard LaTeX
macros, and will prompt for them.  It also knows about the type of the
arguments, so it will for example give completion for the argument to
'\include'.  Some examples are listed below.

 -- Command: TeX-insert-macro
     ('C-c C-m' or 'C-c <RET>') Prompt (with completion) for the name of
     a TeX macro, and if AUCTeX knows the macro, prompt for each
     argument.

   As a default selection, AUCTeX will suggest the macro last inserted
or, as the first choice the value of the variable 'TeX-default-macro'.

 -- User Option: TeX-insert-macro-default-style
     Specifies whether 'TeX-insert-macro' will ask for all optional
     arguments.

     If set to the symbol 'show-optional-args', 'TeX-insert-macro' asks
     for optional arguments of TeX marcos, unless the previous optional
     argument has been rejected.  If set to 'show-all-optional-args',
     'TeX-insert-macro' asks for all optional arguments.
     'mandatory-args-only', 'TeX-insert-macro' asks only for mandatory
     arguments.  When 'TeX-insert-macro' is called with prefix argument
     ('C-u'), it's the other way round.

     Note that for some macros, there are special mechanisms, e.g.
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist' and 'TeX-arg-cite-note-p'.

 -- User Option: TeX-default-macro
     Default macro to insert when invoking 'TeX-insert-macro' first
     time.

   A faster alternative is to bind the function 'TeX-electric-macro' to
'\'.  This can be done by setting the variable 'TeX-electric-escape'

 -- User Option: TeX-electric-escape
     If this is non-nil when AUCTeX is loaded, the TeX escape character
     '\' will be bound to 'TeX-electric-macro'

   The difference between 'TeX-insert-macro' and 'TeX-electric-macro' is
that space will complete and exit from the minibuffer in
'TeX-electric-macro'.  Use <TAB> if you merely want to complete.

 -- Command: TeX-electric-macro
     Prompt (with completion) for the name of a TeX macro, and if AUCTeX
     knows the macro, prompt for each argument.  Space will complete and
     exit.

   By default AUCTeX will put an empty set braces '{}' after a macro
with no arguments to stop it from eating the next whitespace.  This can
be stopped by entering 'LaTeX-math-mode', *note Mathematics::, or by
setting 'TeX-insert-braces' to nil.

 -- User Option: TeX-insert-braces
     If non-nil, append a empty pair of braces after inserting a macro.

 -- User Option: TeX-insert-braces-alist
     Control the insertion of a pair of braces after a macro on a per
     macro basis.

     This variable is an alist.  Each element is a cons cell, whose car
     is the macro name, and the cdr is non-nil or nil, depending on
     whether a pair of braces should be, respectively, appended or not
     to the macro.

     If a macro has an element in this variable, 'TeX-parse-macro' will
     use its value to decided what to do, whatever the value of the
     variable 'TeX-insert-braces'.

   Completions work because AUCTeX can analyze TeX files, and store
symbols in Emacs Lisp files for later retrieval.  *Note Automatic::, for
more information.

   AUCTeX distinguishes normal and expert macros.  By default, it will
offer completion only for normal commands.  This behavior can be
controlled using the user option 'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

 -- User Option: TeX-complete-expert-commands
     Complete macros and environments marked as expert commands.

     Possible values are nil, t, or a list of style names.

     nil
          Don't complete expert commands (default).
     t
          Always complete expert commands.
     (STYLES ...)
          Only complete expert commands of STYLES.

   AUCTeX will also make completion for many macro arguments, for
example existing labels when you enter a '\ref' macro with
'TeX-insert-macro' or 'TeX-electric-macro', and BibTeX entries when you
enter a '\cite' macro.  For this kind of completion to work, parsing
must be enabled as described in *note Parsing Files::.  For '\cite' you
must also make sure that the BibTeX files have been saved at least once
after you enabled automatic parsing on save, and that the basename of
the BibTeX file does not conflict with the basename of one of TeX files.

2.7.1 LaTeX Commands for Marking Environments and Sections
----------------------------------------------------------

 -- Command: LaTeX-mark-section
     ('C-c *') Set mark at end of current logical section, and point at
     top.

     With a non-nil prefix argument, mark only the region from the
     current section start to the next sectioning command.  Thereby
     subsections are not being marked.  Otherwise, any included
     subsections are also marked along with current section.

 -- Command: LaTeX-mark-environment
     ('C-c .') Set mark to the end of the current environment and point
     to the matching beginning.

     If a prefix argument is given, mark the respective number of
     enclosing environments.  The command will not work properly if
     there are unbalanced begin-end pairs in comments and verbatim
     environments.

2.7.2 Texinfo Commands for Marking Environments and Sections
------------------------------------------------------------

 -- Command: Texinfo-mark-section
     ('C-c *') Mark the current section, with inclusion of any
     containing node.

     The current section is detected as starting by any of the
     structuring commands matched by the regular expression in the
     variable 'outline-regexp' which in turn is a regular expression
     matching any element of the variable 'texinfo-section-list'.

     With a non-nil prefix argument, mark only the region from the
     current section start to the next sectioning command.  Thereby
     subsections are not being marked.  Otherwise, any included
     subsections are also marked

     Note that when the current section is starting immediately after a
     node command, then the node command is also marked as part of the
     section.

 -- Command: Texinfo-mark-environment
     ('C-c .') Set mark to the end of the current environment and point
     to the matching beginning.

     If a prefix argument is given, mark the respective number of
     enclosing environments.  The command will not work properly if
     there are unbalanced begin-end pairs in comments and verbatim
     environments.

 -- Command: Texinfo-mark-node
     ('M-C-h') Mark the current node.  This is the node in which point
     is located.  It is starting at the previous occurrence of the
     keyword '@node' and ending at next occurrence of the keywords
     '@node' or '@bye'.

2.8 Commenting
==============

It is often necessary to comment out temporarily a region of TeX or
LaTeX code.  This can be done with the commands 'C-c ;' and 'C-c %'.
'C-c ;' will comment out all lines in the current region, while 'C-c %'
will comment out the current paragraph.  Type 'C-c ;' again to uncomment
all lines of a commented region, or 'C-c %' again to uncomment all
comment lines around point.  These commands will insert or remove a
single '%' respectively.

 -- Command: TeX-comment-or-uncomment-region
     ('C-c ;') Add or remove '%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current region.  Uncommenting works only if the region encloses
     solely commented lines.  If AUCTeX should not try to guess if the
     region should be commented or uncommented the commands
     'TeX-comment-region' and 'TeX-uncomment-region' can be used to
     explicitly comment or uncomment the region in concern.

 -- Command: TeX-comment-or-uncomment-paragraph
     ('C-c %') Add or remove '%' from the beginning of each line in the
     current paragraph.  When removing '%' characters the paragraph is
     considered to consist of all preceding and succeeding lines
     starting with a '%', until the first non-comment line.

2.9 Indenting
=============

Indentation means the addition of whitespace at the beginning of lines
to reflect special syntactical constructs.  This makes it easier to see
the structure of the document, and to catch errors such as a missing
closing brace.  Thus, the indentation is done for precisely the same
reasons that you would indent ordinary computer programs.

   Indentation is done by LaTeX environments and by TeX groups, that is
the body of an environment is indented by the value of
'LaTeX-indent-level' (default 2).  Also, items of an 'itemize-like'
environment are indented by the value of 'LaTeX-item-indent', default
-2.  (Items are identified with the help of 'LaTeX-item-regexp'.)  If
more environments are nested, they are indented 'accumulated' just like
most programming languages usually are seen indented in nested
constructs.

   You can explicitely indent single lines, usually by pressing <TAB>,
or marked regions by calling 'indent-region' on it.  If you have
'auto-fill-mode' enabled and a line is broken while you type it, Emacs
automatically cares about the indentation in the following line.  If you
want to have a similar behavior upon typing <RET>, you can customize the
variable 'TeX-newline-function' and change the default of 'newline'
which does no indentation to 'newline-and-indent' which indents the new
line or 'reindent-then-newline-and-indent' which indents both the
current and the new line.

   There are certain LaTeX environments which should be indented in a
special way, like 'tabular' or 'verbatim'.  Those environments may be
specified in the variable 'LaTeX-indent-environment-list' together with
their special indentation functions.  Taking the 'verbatim' environment
as an example you can see that 'current-indentation' is used as the
indentation function.  This will stop AUCTeX from doing any indentation
in the environment if you hit <TAB> for example.

   There are environments in 'LaTeX-indent-environment-list' which do
not bring a special indentation function with them.  This is due to the
fact that first the respective functions are not implemented yet and
second that filling will be disabled for the specified environments.
This shall prevent the source code from being messed up by accidently
filling those environments with the standard filling routine.  If you
think that providing special filling routines for such environments
would be an appropriate and challenging task for you, you are invited to
contribute.  (*Note Filling::, for further information about the filling
functionality)

   The check for the indentation function may be enabled or disabled by
customizing the variable 'LaTeX-indent-environment-check'.

   As a side note with regard to formatting special environments: Newer
Emacsen include 'align.el' and therefore provide some support for
formatting 'tabular' and 'tabbing' environments with the function
'align-current' which will nicely align columns in the source code.

   AUCTeX is able to format commented parts of your code just as any
other part.  This means LaTeX environments and TeX groups in comments
will be indented syntactically correct if the variable
'LaTeX-syntactic-comments' is set to t.  If you disable it, comments
will be filled like normal text and no syntactic indentation will be
done.

   Following you will find a list of most commands and variables related
to indenting with a small summary in each case:

'<TAB>'
     'LaTeX-indent-line' will indent the current line.

'<LFD>'
     'newline-and-indent' inserts a new line (much like <RET>) and moves
     the cursor to an appropriate position by the left margin.

     Most keyboards nowadays lack a linefeed key and 'C-j' may be
     tedious to type.  Therefore you can customize AUCTeX to perform
     indentation upon typing <RET> as well.  The respective option is
     called 'TeX-newline-function'.

'C-j'
     Alias for <LFD>

 -- User Option: LaTeX-indent-environment-list
     List of environments with special indentation.  The second element
     in each entry is the function to calculate the indentation level in
     columns.

     The filling code currently cannot handle tabular-like environments
     which will be completely messed-up if you try to format them.  This
     is why most of these environments are included in this
     customization option without a special indentation function.  This
     will prevent that they get filled.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each '\begin' not
     matched by a '\end'.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-item-indent
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for '\item''s in list
     environments.

 -- User Option: TeX-brace-indent-level
     Number of spaces to add to the indentation for each '{' not matched
     by a '}'.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-syntactic-comments
     If non-nil comments will be filled and indented according to LaTeX
     syntax.  Otherwise they will be filled like normal text.

 -- User Option: TeX-newline-function
     Used to specify the function which is called when <RET> is pressed.
     This will normally be 'newline' which simply inserts a new line.
     In case you want to have AUCTeX do indentation as well when you
     press <RET>, use the built-in functions 'newline-and-indent' or
     'reindent-then-newline-and-indent'.  The former inserts a new line
     and indents the following line, i.e.  it moves the cursor to the
     right position and therefore acts as if you pressed <LFD>.  The
     latter function additionally indents the current line.  If you
     choose 'Other', you can specify your own fancy function to be
     called when <RET> is pressed.

2.10 Filling
============

Filling deals with the insertion of line breaks to prevent lines from
becoming wider than what is specified in 'fill-column'.  The linebreaks
will be inserted automatically if 'auto-fill-mode' is enabled.  In this
case the source is not only filled but also indented automatically as
you write it.

   'auto-fill-mode' can be enabled for AUCTeX by calling
'turn-on-auto-fill' in one of the hooks AUCTeX is running.  *Note Modes
and Hooks::.  As an example, if you want to enable 'auto-fill-mode' in
'LaTeX-mode', put the following into your init file:

     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'turn-on-auto-fill)

   You can manually fill explicitely marked regions, paragraphs,
environments, complete sections, or the whole buffer.  (Note that manual
filling in AUCTeX will indent the start of the region to be filled in
contrast to many other Emacs modes.)

   There are some syntactical constructs which are handled specially
with regard to filling.  These are so-called code comments and paragraph
commands.

   Code comments are comments preceded by code or text in the same line.
Upon filling a region, code comments themselves will not get filled.
Filling is done from the start of the region to the line with the code
comment and continues after it.  In order to prevent overfull lines in
the source code, a linebreak will be inserted before the last
non-comment word by default.  This can be changed by customizing
'LaTeX-fill-break-before-code-comments'.  If you have overfull lines
with code comments you can fill those explicitely by calling
'LaTeX-fill-paragraph' or pressing 'M-q' with the cursor positioned on
them.  This will add linebreaks in the comment and indent subsequent
comment lines to the column of the comment in the first line of the code
comment.  In this special case 'M-q' only acts on the current line and
not on the whole paragraph.

   Lines with '\par' are treated similarly to code comments, i.e.
'\par' will be treated as paragraph boundary which should not be
followed by other code or text.  But it is not treated as a real
paragraph boundary like an empty line where filling a paragraph would
stop.

   Paragraph commands like '\section' or '\noindent' (the list of
commands is defined by 'LaTeX-paragraph-commands') are often to be
placed in their own line(s).  This means they should not be consecuted
with any preceding or following adjacent lines of text.  AUCTeX will
prevent this from happening if you do not put any text except another
macro after the end of the last brace of the respective macro.  If there
is other text after the macro, AUCTeX regards this as a sign that the
macro is part of the following paragraph.

   Here are some examples:

     \begin{quote}
       text text text text

     \begin{quote}\label{foo}
       text text text text

   If you press 'M-q' on the first line in both examples, nothing will
change.  But if you write

     \begin{quote} text
       text text text text

   and press 'M-q', you will get

     \begin{quote} text text text text text

   Besides code comments and paragraph commands, another speciality of
filling in AUCTeX involves commented lines.  You should be aware that
these comments are treated as islands in the rest of the LaTeX code if
syntactic filling is enabled.  This means, for example, if you try to
fill an environment with 'LaTeX-fill-environment' and have the cursor
placed on a commented line which does not have a surrounding environment
inside the comment, AUCTeX will report an error.

   The relevant commands and variables with regard to filling are:

'C-c C-q C-p'
     'LaTeX-fill-paragraph' will fill and indent the current paragraph.

'M-q'
     Alias for 'C-c C-q C-p'

'C-c C-q C-e'
     'LaTeX-fill-environment' will fill and indent the current
     environment.  This may e.g.  be the 'document' environment, in
     which case the entire document will be formatted.

'C-c C-q C-s'
     'LaTeX-fill-section' will fill and indent the current logical
     sectional unit.

'C-c C-q C-r'
     'LaTeX-fill-region' will fill and indent the current region.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-fill-break-at-separators
     List of separators before or after which respectively linebreaks
     will be inserted if they do not fit into one line.  The separators
     can be curly braces, brackets, switches for inline math ('$', '\(',
     '\)') and switches for display math ('\[', '\]').  Such formatting
     can be useful to make macros and math more visible or to prevent
     overfull lines in the LaTeX source in case a package for displaying
     formatted TeX output inside the Emacs buffer, like preview-latex,
     is used.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-fill-break-before-code-comments
     Code comments are comments preceded by some other text in the same
     line.  When a paragraph containing such a comment is to be filled,
     the comment start will be seen as a border after which no line
     breaks will be inserted in the same line.  If the option
     'LaTeX-fill-break-before-code-comments' is enabled (which is the
     default) and the comment does not fit into the line, a line break
     will be inserted before the last non-comment word to minimize the
     chance that the line becomes overfull.

3 Controlling Screen Display
****************************

It is often desirable to get visual help of what markup code in a text
actually does without having to decipher it explicitly.  For this
purpose Emacs and AUCTeX provide font locking (also known as syntax
highlighting) which visually sets off markup code like macros or
environments by using different colors or fonts.  For example text to be
typeset in italics can be displayed with an italic font in the editor as
well, or labels and references get their own distinct color.

   While font locking helps you grasp the purpose of markup code and
separate markup from content, the markup code can still be distracting.
AUCTeX lets you hide those parts and show them again at request with its
built-in support for hiding macros and environments which we call
folding here.

   Besides folding of macros and environments, AUCTeX provides support
for Emacs' outline mode which lets you narrow the buffer content to
certain sections of your text by hiding the parts not belonging to these
sections.

   Moreover, you can focus in a specific portion of the code by
narrowing the buffer to the desired region.  AUCTeX provides also
functions to narrow the buffer to the current group and to LaTeX
environments.

3.1 Font Locking
================

Font locking is supposed to improve readability of the source code by
highlighting certain keywords with different colors or fonts.  It
thereby lets you recognize the function of markup code to a certain
extent without having to read the markup command.  For general
information on controlling font locking with Emacs' Font Lock mode, see
*note Font Lock Mode: (emacs)Font Lock.

 -- User Option: TeX-install-font-lock
     Once font locking is enabled globally or for the major modes
     provided by AUCTeX, the font locking patterns and functionality of
     font-latex are activated by default.  You can switch to a different
     font locking scheme or disable font locking in AUCTeX by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-install-font-lock'.

     Besides font-latex AUCTeX ships with a scheme which is derived from
     Emacs' default LaTeX mode and activated by choosing
     'tex-font-setup'.  Be aware that this scheme is not coupled with
     AUCTeX's style system and not the focus of development.  Therefore
     and due to font-latex being much more feature-rich the following
     explanations will only cover font-latex.

     In case you want to hook in your own fontification scheme, you can
     choose 'other' and insert the name of the function which sets up
     your font locking patterns.  If you want to disable fontification
     in AUCTeX completely, choose 'ignore'.

   font-latex provides many options for customization which are
accessible with 'M-x customize-group RET font-latex RET'.  For this
description the various options are explained in conceptional groups.

3.1.1 Fontification of macros
-----------------------------

Highlighting of macros can be customized by adapting keyword lists which
can be found in the customization group 'font-latex-keywords'.

   Three types of macros can be handled differently with respect to
fontification:

  1. Commands of the form '\foo[bar]{baz}' which consist of the macro
     itself, optional arguments in square brackets and mandatory
     arguments in curly braces.  For the command itself the face
     'font-lock-keyword-face' will be used and for the optional
     arguments the face 'font-lock-variable-name-face'.  The face
     applied to the mandatory argument depends on the macro class
     represented by the respective built-in variables.
  2. Declaration macros of the form '{\foo text}' which consist of the
     macro which may be enclosed in a TeX group together with text to be
     affected by the macro.  In case a TeX group is present, the macro
     will get the face 'font-lock-keyword-face' and the text will get
     the face configured for the respective macro class.  If no TeX
     group is present, the latter face will be applied to the macro
     itself.
  3. Simple macros of the form '\foo' which do not have any arguments or
     groupings.  The respective face will be applied to the macro
     itself.

   Customization variables for '\foo[bar]{baz}' type macros allow both
the macro name and the sequence of arguments to be specified.  The
latter is done with a string which can contain the characters
'*'
     indicating the existence of a starred variant for the macro,
'['
     for optional arguments in brackets,
'{'
     for mandatory arguments in braces,
'\'
     for mandatory arguments consisting of a single macro and
'|'
     as a prefix indicating that two alternatives are following.
   For example the specifier for '\documentclass' would be '[{' because
the macro has one optional followed by one mandatory argument.  The
specifier for '\newcommand' would be '*|{\[[{' because there is a
starred variant, the mandatory argument following the macro name can be
a macro or a TeX group which can be followed by two optional arguments
and the last token is a mandatory argument in braces.

   Customization variables for the '{\foo text}' and '\foo' types are
simple lists of strings where each entry is a macro name (without the
leading backslash).

General macro classes
---------------------

font-latex provides keyword lists for different macro classes which are
described in the following table:

'font-latex-match-function-keywords'
     Keywords for macros defining or related to functions, like
     '\newcommand'.
     Type: '\macro[...]{...}'
     Face: 'font-lock-function-name-face'

'font-latex-match-reference-keywords'
     Keywords for macros defining or related to references, like '\ref'.
     Type: '\macro[...]{...}'
     Face: 'font-lock-constant-face'

'font-latex-match-textual-keywords'
     Keywords for macros specifying textual content, like '\caption'.
     Type: '\macro[...]{...}'
     Face: 'font-lock-type-face'

'font-latex-match-variable-keywords'
     Keywords for macros defining or related to variables, like
     '\setlength'.
     Type: '\macro[...]{...}'
     Face: 'font-lock-variable-name-face'

'font-latex-match-warning-keywords'
     Keywords for important macros, e.g.  affecting line or page break,
     like '\clearpage'.
     Type: '\macro'
     Face: 'font-latex-warning-face'

Sectioning commands
-------------------

Sectioning commands are macros like '\chapter' or '\section'.  For these
commands there are two fontification schemes which may be selected by
customizing the variable 'font-latex-fontify-sectioning'.

 -- User Option: font-latex-fontify-sectioning
     Per default sectioning commands will be shown in a larger,
     proportional font, which corresponds to a number for this variable.
     The font size varies with the sectioning level, e.g.  '\part'
     ('font-latex-sectioning-0-face') has a larger font than
     '\paragraph' ('font-latex-sectioning-5-face').  Typically, values
     from 1.05 to 1.3 for 'font-latex-fontify-sectioning' give best
     results, depending on your font setup.  If you rather like to use
     the base font and a different color, set the variable to the symbol
     'color'.  In this case the face 'font-lock-type-face' will be used
     to fontify the argument of the sectioning commands.

   You can make font-latex aware of your own sectioning commands be
adding them to the keyword lists:
'font-latex-match-sectioning-0-keywords'
('font-latex-sectioning-0-face') ...
'font-latex-match-sectioning-5-keywords'
('font-latex-sectioning-5-face').

   Related to sectioning there is special support for slide titles which
may be fontified with the face 'font-latex-slide-title-face'.  You can
add macros which should appear in this face by customizing the variable
'font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords'.

Commands for changing fonts
---------------------------

LaTeX provides various macros for changing fonts or font attributes.
For example, you can select an italic font with '\textit{...}' or bold
with '\textbf{...}'.  An alternative way to specify these fonts is to
use special macros in TeX groups, like '{\itshape ...}' for italics and
'{\bfseries ...}' for bold.  As mentioned above, we call the former
variants commands and the latter declarations.

   Besides the macros for changing fonts provided by LaTeX there is an
infinite number of other macros--either defined by yourself for logical
markup or defined by macro packages--which affect the font in the
typeset text.  While LaTeX's built-in macros and macros of packages
known by AUCTeX are already handled by font-latex, different keyword
lists per type style and macro type are provided for entering your own
macros which are listed in the table below.

'font-latex-match-bold-command-keywords'
     Keywords for commands specifying a bold type style.
     Face: 'font-latex-bold-face'
'font-latex-match-italic-command-keywords'
     Keywords for commands specifying an italic font.
     Face: 'font-latex-italic-face'
'font-latex-match-math-command-keywords'
     Keywords for commands specifying a math font.
     Face: 'font-latex-math-face'
'font-latex-match-type-command-keywords'
     Keywords for commands specifying a typewriter font.
     Face: 'font-lock-type-face'
'font-latex-match-bold-declaration-keywords'
     Keywords for declarations specifying a bold type style.
     Face: 'font-latex-bold-face'
'font-latex-match-italic-declaration-keywords'
     Keywords for declarations specifying an italic font.
     Face: 'font-latex-italic-face'
'font-latex-match-type-declaration-keywords'
     Keywords for declarations specifying a typewriter font.
     Face: 'font-latex-type-face'

Deactivating defaults of built-in keyword classes
-------------------------------------------------

font-latex ships with predefined lists of keywords for the classes
described above.  You can disable these defaults per class by
customizing the variable 'font-latex-deactivated-keyword-classes'.  This
is a list of strings for keyword classes to be deactivated.  Valid
entries are "warning", "variable", "reference", "function" ,
"sectioning-0", "sectioning-1", "sectioning-2", "sectioning-3",
"sectioning-4", "sectioning-5", "textual", "bold-command",
"italic-command", "math-command", "type-command", "bold-declaration",
"italic-declaration", "type-declaration".

   You can also get rid of certain keywords only.  For example if you
want to remove highlighting of footnotes as references you can put the
following stanza into your init file:

     (eval-after-load "font-latex"
       '(setq-default
         font-latex-match-reference-keywords-local
         (remove "footnote" font-latex-match-reference-keywords-local)))

   But note that this means fiddling with font-latex's internals and is
not guaranteed to work in future versions of font-latex.

User-defined keyword classes
----------------------------

In case the customization options explained above do not suffice for
your needs, you can specify your own keyword classes by customizing the
variable 'font-latex-user-keyword-classes'.

 -- User Option: font-latex-user-keyword-classes
     Every keyword class consists of four parts, a name, a list of
     keywords, a face and a specifier for the type of macros to be
     highlighted.

     When adding new entries, you have to use unique values for the
     class names, i.e.  they must not clash with names of the built-in
     keyword classes or other names given by you.  Additionally the
     names must not contain spaces.

     The list of keywords defines which commands and declarations should
     be covered by the keyword class.  A keyword can either be a simple
     command name omitting the leading backslash or a list consisting of
     the command name and a string specifying the sequence of arguments
     for the command.

     The face argument can either be an existing face or font
     specifications made by you.  (The latter option is not available on
     XEmacs.)

     There are three alternatives for the type of keywords--"Command
     with arguments", "Declaration inside TeX group" and "Command
     without arguments"--which correspond with the macro types explained
     above.

3.1.2 Fontification of quotes
-----------------------------

Text in quotation marks is displayed with the face
'font-latex-string-face'.  Besides the various forms of opening and
closing double and single quotation marks, so-called guillemets (<<, >>)
can be used for quoting.  Because there are two styles of using
them--French style: << text >>; German style: >>text<<--you can
customize the variable 'font-latex-quotes' to tell font-latex which type
you are using if the correct value cannot be derived from document
properties.

 -- User Option: font-latex-quotes
     The default value of 'font-latex-quotes' is 'auto' which means that
     font-latex will try to derive the correct type of quotation mark
     matching from document properties like the language option supplied
     to the babel LaTeX package.

     If the automatic detection fails for you and you mostly use one
     specific style you can set it to a specific language-dependent
     value as well.  Set the value to 'german' if you are using >>German
     quotes<< and to 'french' if you are using << French quotes >>.
     font-latex will recognize the different ways these quotes can be
     given in your source code, i.e.  ('"<', '">'), ('<<', '>>') and the
     respective 8-bit variants.

     If you set 'font-latex-quotes' to nil, quoted content will not be
     fontified.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Fontification of math,  Next: Verbatim content,  Prev: Fontification of quotes,  Up: Font Locking

3.1.3 Fontification of mathematical constructs
----------------------------------------------

In LaTeX mathematics can be indicated by a variety of different methods:
toggles (like dollar signs), macros and environments.  Math constructs
known by font-latex are displayed with the face 'font-latex-math-face'.
Support for dollar signs and shorthands like '\(...\)' or '\[...\]' is
built-in and not customizable.  Support for other math macros and
environments can be adapted by customizing the variables
'font-latex-match-math-command-keywords' and
'font-latex-math-environments' respectively.

   In order to make math constructs more readable, font-latex displays
subscript and superscript parts in a smaller font and raised or lowered
respectively.  This fontification feature can be controlled with the
variables 'font-latex-fontify-script' and 'font-latex-script-display'.

 -- User Option: font-latex-fontify-script
     If non-nil, fontify subscript and superscript strings.

     Note that this feature is not available on XEmacs, for which it is
     disabled per default.  In GNU Emacs raising and lowering is not
     enabled for versions 21.3 and before due to it working not
     properly.

 -- User Option: font-latex-script-display
     Display specification for subscript and superscript content.  The
     car is used for subscript, the cdr is used for superscript.  The
     feature is implemented using so-called display properties.  For
     information on what exactly to specify for the values, see *note
     Other Display Specifications: (elisp)Other Display Specs.

3.1.4 Verbatim macros and environments
--------------------------------------

Usually it is not desirable to have content to be typeset verbatim
highlighted according to LaTeX syntax.  Therefore this content will be
fontified uniformly with the face 'font-latex-verbatim-face'.

   font-latex differentiates three different types of verbatim
constructs for fontification.  Macros with special characters like | as
delimiters, macros with braces, and environments.  Which macros and
environments are recognized is controlled by the variables
'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims',
'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces', and 'LaTeX-verbatim-environments'
respectively.

3.1.5 Faces used by font-latex
------------------------------

In case you want to change the colors and fonts used by font-latex
please refer to the faces mentioned in the explanations above and use
'M-x customize-face RET <face> RET'.  All faces defined by font-latex
are accessible through a customization group by typing 'M-x
customize-group RET font-latex-highlighting-faces RET'.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Known problems,  Prev: Faces,  Up: Font Locking

3.1.6 Known fontification problems
----------------------------------

In certain cases the fontification machinery fails to interpret buffer
contents correctly.  This can lead to color bleed, i.e.  large parts of
a buffer get fontified with an inappropriate face.  A typical situation
for this to happen is the use of a dollar sign ('$') in a verbatim macro
or environment.  If font-latex is not aware of the verbatim construct,
it assumes the dollar sign to be a toggle for mathematics and fontifies
the following buffer content with the respective face until it finds a
closing dollar sign or till the end of the buffer.

   As a remedy you can make the verbatim construct known to font-latex,
*note Verbatim content::.  If this is not possible, you can insert a
commented dollar sign ('%$') at the next suitable end of line as a quick
workaround.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Folding,  Next: Outline,  Prev: Font Locking,  Up: Display

3.2 Folding Macros and Environments
===================================

A popular complaint about markup languages like TeX and LaTeX is that
there is too much clutter in the source text and that one cannot focus
well on the content.  There are macros where you are only interested in
the content they are enclosing, like font specifiers where the content
might already be fontified in a special way by font locking.  Or macros
the content of which you only want to see when actually editing it, like
footnotes or citations.  Similarly you might find certain environments
or comments distracting when trying to concentrate on the body of your
document.

   With AUCTeX's folding functionality you can collapse those items and
replace them by a fixed string, the content of one of their arguments,
or a mixture of both.  If you want to make the original text visible
again in order to view or edit it, move point sideways onto the
placeholder (also called display string) or left-click with the mouse
pointer on it.  (The latter is currently only supported on Emacs.)  The
macro or environment will unfold automatically, stay open as long as
point is inside of it and collapse again once you move point out of it.
(Note that folding of environments currently does not work in every
AUCTeX mode.)

   In order to use this feature, you have to activate 'TeX-fold-mode'
which will activate the auto-reveal feature and the necessary commands
to hide and show macros and environments.  You can activate the mode in
a certain buffer by typing the command 'M-x TeX-fold-mode RET' or using
the keyboard shortcut 'C-c C-o C-f'.  If you want to use it every time
you edit a LaTeX document, add it to a hook:

     (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                  (TeX-fold-mode 1)))

   If it should be activated in all AUCTeX modes, use 'TeX-mode-hook'
instead of 'LaTeX-mode-hook'.

   Once the mode is active there are several commands available to hide
and show macros, environments and comments:

 -- Command: TeX-fold-buffer
     ('C-c C-o C-b') Hide all foldable items in the current buffer
     according to the setting of 'TeX-fold-type-list'.

     If you want to have this done automatically every time you open a
     file, add it to a hook and make sure the function is called after
     font locking is set up for the buffer.  The following code should
     accomplish this:

          (add-hook 'find-file-hook 'TeX-fold-buffer t)

     The command can be used any time to refresh the whole buffer and
     fold any new macros and environments which were inserted after the
     last invocation of the command.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-type-list
     List of symbols determining the item classes to consider for
     folding.  This can be macros, environments and comments.  Per
     default only macros and environments are folded.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-force-fontify
     In order for all folded content to get the right faces, the whole
     buffer has to be fontified before folding is carried out.
     'TeX-fold-buffer' therefore will force fontification of unfontified
     regions.  As this will prolong the time folding takes, you can
     prevent forced fontification by customizing the variable
     'TeX-fold-force-fontify'.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-auto
     By default, a macro inserted with 'TeX-insert-macro' ('C-c C-m')
     will not be folded.  Set this variable to a non-nil value to
     aumatically fold macros as soon as they are inserted.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-preserve-comments
     By default items found in comments will be folded.  If your
     comments often contain unfinished code this might lead to problems.
     Give this variable a non-nil value and foldable items in your
     comments will be left alone.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-unfold-around-mark
     When this variable is non-nil and there is an active regione, text
     around the mark will be kept unfolded.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-region
     ('C-c C-o C-r') Hide all configured macros in the marked region.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-paragraph
     ('C-c C-o C-p') Hide all configured macros in the paragraph
     containing point.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-macro
     ('C-c C-o C-m') Hide the macro on which point currently is located.
     If the name of the macro is found in 'TeX-fold-macro-spec-list',
     the respective display string will be shown instead.  If it is not
     found, the name of the macro in sqare brackets or the default
     string for unspecified macros
     ('TeX-fold-unspec-macro-display-string') will be shown, depending
     on the value of the variable 'TeX-fold-unspec-use-name'.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-env
     ('C-c C-o C-e') Hide the environment on which point currently is
     located.  The behavior regarding the display string is analogous to
     'TeX-fold-macro' and determined by the variables
     'TeX-fold-env-spec-list' and 'TeX-fold-unspec-env-display-string'
     respectively.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-math
     Hide the math macro on which point currently is located.  If the
     name of the macro is found in 'TeX-fold-math-spec-list', the
     respective display string will be shown instead.  If it is not
     found, the name of the macro in sqare brackets or the default
     string for unspecified macros
     ('TeX-fold-unspec-macro-display-string') will be shown, depending
     on the value of the variable 'TeX-fold-unspec-use-name'.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-comment
     ('C-c C-o C-c') Hide the comment point is located on.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-clearout-buffer
     ('C-c C-o b') Permanently unfold all macros and environments in the
     current buffer.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-clearout-region
     ('C-c C-o r') Permanently unfold all macros and environments in the
     marked region.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-clearout-paragraph
     ('C-c C-o p') Permanently unfold all macros and environments in the
     paragraph containing point.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-clearout-item
     ('C-c C-o i') Permanently show the macro or environment on which
     point currently is located.  In contrast to temporarily opening the
     macro when point is moved sideways onto it, the macro will be
     permanently unfolded and will not collapse again once point is
     leaving it.

 -- Command: TeX-fold-dwim
     ('C-c C-o C-o') Hide or show items according to the current
     context.  If there is folded content, unfold it.  If there is a
     marked region, fold all configured content in this region.  If
     there is no folded content but a macro or environment, fold it.

   In case you want to use a different prefix than 'C-c C-o' for these
commands you can customize the variable 'TeX-fold-command-prefix'.
(Note that this will not change the key binding for activating the
mode.)

   The commands above will only take macros or environments into
consideration which are specified in the variables
'TeX-fold-macro-spec-list' or 'TeX-fold-env-spec-list' respectively.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-macro-spec-list
     List of replacement specifiers and macros to fold.  The specifier
     can be a string, an integer or a function symbol.

     If you specify a string, it will be used as a display replacement
     for the whole macro.  Numbers in braces, brackets, parens or angle
     brackets will be replaced by the respective macro argument.  For
     example '{1}' will be replaced by the first mandatory argument of
     the macro.  One can also define alternatives within the specifier
     which are used if an argument is not found.  Alternatives are
     separated by '||'.  They are most useful with optional arguments.
     As an example, the default specifier for '\item' is '[1]:||*' which
     means that if there is an optional argument, its value is shown
     followed by a colon.  If there is no optional argument, only an
     asterisk is used as the display string.

     If you specify a number as the first element, the content of the
     respective mandatory argument of a LaTeX macro will be used as the
     placeholder.

     If the first element is a function symbol, the function will be
     called with all mandatory arguments of the macro and the result of
     the function call will be used as a replacement for the macro.

     The placeholder is made by copying the text from the buffer
     together with its properties, i.e.  its face as well.  If
     fontification has not happened when this is done (e.g.  because of
     lazy font locking) the intended fontification will not show up.  As
     a workaround you can leave Emacs idle a few seconds and wait for
     stealth font locking to finish before you fold the buffer.  Or you
     just re-fold the buffer with 'TeX-fold-buffer' when you notice a
     wrong fontification.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-env-spec-list
     List of display strings or argument numbers and environments to
     fold.  Argument numbers refer to the '\begin' statement.  That
     means if you have e.g.  '\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{XXX} ...
     \end{tabularx}' and specify 3 as the argument number, the resulting
     display string will be "XXX".

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-math-spec-list
     List of display strings and math macros to fold.

   The variables 'TeX-fold-macro-spec-list', 'TeX-fold-env-spec-list',
and 'TeX-fold-math-spec-list' apply to any AUCTeX mode.  If you want to
make settings which are only applied to LaTeX mode, you can use the
mode-specific variables 'LaTeX-fold-macro-spec-list',
'LaTeX-fold-env-spec-list', and 'LaTeX-fold-math-spec-list'

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-unspec-macro-display-string
     Default display string for macros which are not specified in
     'TeX-fold-macro-spec-list'.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-unspec-env-display-string
     Default display string for environments which are not specified in
     'TeX-fold-env-spec-list'.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-unspec-use-name
     If non-nil the name of the macro or environment surrounded by
     square brackets is used as display string, otherwise the defaults
     specified in 'TeX-fold-unspec-macro-display-string' or
     'TeX-fold-unspec-env-display-string' respectively.

   When you hover with the mouse pointer over folded content, its
original text will be shown in a tooltip or the echo area depending on
Tooltip mode being activate.  In order to avoid exorbitantly big
tooltips and to cater for the limited space in the echo area the content
will be cropped after a certain amount of characters defined by the
variable 'TeX-fold-help-echo-max-length'.

 -- User Option: TeX-fold-help-echo-max-length
     Maximum length of original text displayed in a tooltip or the echo
     area for folded content.  Set it to zero in order to disable this
     feature.

3.3 Outlining the Document
==========================

AUCTeX supports the standard outline minor mode using LaTeX/ConTeXt
sectioning commands as header lines.  *Note Outline Mode: (emacs)Outline
Mode.

   You can add your own headings by setting the variable
'TeX-outline-extra'.

 -- Variable: TeX-outline-extra
     List of extra TeX outline levels.

     Each element is a list with two entries.  The first entry is the
     regular expression matching a header, and the second is the level
     of the header.  A '^' is automatically prepended to the regular
     expressions in the list, so they must match text at the beginning
     of the line.

     See 'LaTeX-section-list' or 'ConTeXt-INTERFACE-section-list' for
     existing header levels.

   The following example add '\item' and '\bibliography' headers, with
'\bibliography' at the same outline level as '\section', and '\item'
being below '\subparagraph'.

     (setq TeX-outline-extra
           '(("[ \t]*\\\\\\(bib\\)?item\\b" 7)
     	("\\\\bibliography\\b" 2)))

   You may want to check out the unbundled 'out-xtra' package for even
better outline support.  It is available from your favorite emacs lisp
archive.

3.4 Narrowing
=============

Sometimes you want to focus your attention to a limited region of the
code.  You can do that by restricting the text addressable by editing
commands and hiding the rest of the buffer with the narrowing functions,
*note (emacs)Narrowing::.  In addition, AUCTeX provides a couple of
other commands to narrow the buffer to a group, i.e.  a region enclosed
in a pair of curly braces, and to LaTeX environments.

 -- Command: TeX-narrow-to-group
     ('C-x n g') Make text outside current group invisible.

 -- Command: LaTeX-narrow-to-environment COUNT
     ('C-x n e') Make text outside current environment invisible.  With
     optional argument COUNT keep visible that number of enclosing
     environmens.

   Like other standard narrowing functions, the above commands are
disabled.  Attempting to use them asks for confirmation and gives you
the option of enabling them; if you enable the commands, confirmation
will no longer be required for them.

The most powerful features of AUCTeX may be those allowing you to run
TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt and other external commands like BibTeX and
'makeindex' from within Emacs, viewing and printing the results, and
moreover allowing you to _debug_ your documents.

   AUCTeX comes with a special tool bar for TeX and LaTeX which provides
buttons for the most important commands.  You can enable or disable it
by customizing the options 'plain-TeX-enable-toolbar' and
'LaTeX-enable-toolbar' in the 'TeX-tool-bar' customization group.

======================

Formatting the document with TeX, LaTeX or ConTeXt, viewing with a
previewer, printing the document, running BibTeX, making an index, or
checking the document with 'lacheck' or 'chktex' all require running an
external command.

File: auctex.info,  Node: Starting a Command,  Next: Selecting a Command,  Up: Commands

4.1.1 Starting a Command on a Document or Region
------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to run an external command, you can either run it on
the current document with 'TeX-command-master', or on the current region
with 'TeX-command-region'.  A special case of running TeX on a region is
'TeX-command-buffer' which differs from 'TeX-command-master' if the
current buffer is not its own master file.

 -- Command: TeX-command-master
     ('C-c C-c') Query the user for a command, and run it on the master
     file associated with the current buffer.  The name of the master
     file is controlled by the variable 'TeX-master'.  The available
     commands are controlled by the variable 'TeX-command-list'.

 -- Command: TeX-command-region
     ('C-c C-r') Query the user for a command, and run it on the
     contents of the selected region.  The region contents are written
     into the region file, after extracting the header and trailer from
     the master file.  If mark is inactive (which can happen with
     Transient Mark mode), use the old region.  See also the command
     'TeX-pin-region' about how to fix a region.

     The name of the region file is controlled by the variable
     'TeX-region'.  The name of the master file is controlled by the
     variable 'TeX-master'.  The header is all text up to the line
     matching the regular expression 'TeX-header-end'.  The trailer is
     all text from the line matching the regular expression
     'TeX-trailer-start'.  The available commands are controlled by the
     variable 'TeX-command-list'.

 -- Command: TeX-command-buffer
     ('C-c C-b') Query the user for a command, and apply it to the
     contents of the current buffer.  The buffer contents are written
     into the region file, after extracting the header and trailer from
     the master file.  The command is then actually run on the region
     file.  See above for details.

 -- User Option: TeX-region
     The name of the file for temporarily storing the text when
     formatting the current region.

 -- User Option: TeX-header-end
     A regular expression matching the end of the header.  By default,
     this is '\begin{document}' in LaTeX mode and '%**end of header' in
     TeX mode.

 -- User Option: TeX-trailer-start
     A regular expression matching the start of the trailer.  By
     default, this is '\end{document}' in LaTeX mode and '\bye' in TeX
     mode.

   If you want to change the values of 'TeX-header-end' and
'TeX-trailer-start' you can do this for all files by setting the
variables in a mode hook or per file by specifying them as file
variables (*note (emacs)File Variables::).

 -- Command: TeX-pin-region
     ('C-c C-t C-r') If you don't have a mode like Transient Mark mode
     active, where marks get disabled automatically, the region would
     need to get properly set before each call to 'TeX-command-region'.
     If you fix the current region with 'C-c C-t C-r', then it will get
     used for more commands even though mark and point may change.  An
     explicitly activated mark, however, will always define a new region
     when calling 'TeX-command-region'.

   AUCTeX will allow one process for each document, plus one process for
the region file to be active at the same time.  Thus, if you are editing
N different documents, you can have N plus one processes running at the
same time.  If the last process you started was on the region, the
commands described in *note Debugging:: and *note Control:: will work on
that process, otherwise they will work on the process associated with
the current document.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Selecting a Command,  Next: Processor Options,  Prev: Starting a Command,  Up: Commands

4.1.2 Selecting and Executing a Command
---------------------------------------

Once you started the command selection with 'C-c C-c', 'C-c C-s' or 'C-c
C-b' you will be prompted for the type of command.  AUCTeX will try to
guess which command is appropriate in the given situation and propose it
as default.  Usually this is a processor like 'TeX' or 'LaTeX' if the
document was changed or a viewer if the document was just typeset.
Other commands can be selected in the minibuffer with completion support
by typing <TAB>.

   The available commands are defined by the variable
'TeX-command-list'.  Per default it includes commands for typesetting
the document (e.g.  'LaTeX'), for viewing the output ('View'), for
printing ('Print'), for generating an index ('Index') or for spell
checking ('Spell') to name but a few.  You can also add your own
commands by adding entries to 'TeX-command-list'.  Refer to its doc
string for information about its syntax.  You might also want to look at
'TeX-expand-list' to learn about the expanders you can use in
'TeX-command-list'.

   Note that the default of the variable occasionally changes.
Therefore it is advisable to add to the list rather than overwriting it.
You can do this with a call to 'add-to-list' in your init file.  For
example, if you wanted to add a command for running a program called
'foo' on the master or region file, you could do this with the following
form.

     (eval-after-load "tex"
       '(add-to-list 'TeX-command-list
     		'("Foo" "foo %s" TeX-run-command t t :help "Run foo") t))

   As mentioned before, AUCTeX will try to guess what command you want
to invoke.  If you want to use another command than 'TeX', 'LaTeX' or
whatever processor AUCTeX thinks is appropriate for the current mode,
set the variable 'TeX-command-default'.  You can do this for all files
by setting it in a mode hook or per file by specifying it as a file
variable (*note (emacs)File Variables::).

 -- User Option: TeX-command-default
     The default command to run in this buffer.  Must be an entry in
     'TeX-command-list'.

   In case you use biblatex in a document, when automatic parsing is
enabled AUCTeX checks the value of 'backend' option given to biblatex at
load time to decide whether to use BibTeX or Biber for bibliography
processing.  Should AUCTeX fail to detect the right backend, you can use
the file local 'LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber' variable.
 -- Variable: LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber
     If this boolean variable is set as file local, it tells to AUCTeX
     whether to use Biber with biblatex.  In this case, the
     autodetection of the biblatex backend will be overridden.  You may
     want to set locally this variable if automatic parsing is not
     enabled.

   After confirming a command to execute, AUCTeX will try to save any
buffers related to the document, and check if the document needs to be
reformatted.  If the variable 'TeX-save-query' is non-nil, AUCTeX will
query before saving each file.  By default AUCTeX will check emacs
buffers associated with files in the current directory, in one of the
'TeX-macro-private' directories, and in the 'TeX-macro-global'
directories.  You can change this by setting the variable
'TeX-check-path'.

 -- User Option: TeX-check-path
     Directory path to search for dependencies.

     If nil, just check the current file.  Used when checking if any
     files have changed.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Processor Options,  Prev: Selecting a Command,  Up: Commands

4.1.3 Options for TeX Processors
--------------------------------

There are some options you can customize affecting which processors are
invoked or the way this is done and which output they produce as a
result.  These options control if DVI or PDF output should be produced,
if TeX should be started in interactive or nonstop mode, if source
specials or a SyncTeX file should be produced for making inverse and
forward search possible or which TeX engine should be used instead of
regular TeX, like PDFTeX, Omega or XeTeX.

 -- Command: TeX-PDF-mode
     ('C-c C-t C-p') This command toggles the PDF mode of AUCTeX, a
     buffer-local minor mode which is enabled by default.  You can
     customize 'TeX-PDF-mode' to give it a different default or set it
     as a file local variable on a per-document basis.  This option
     usually results in calling either PDFTeX or ordinary TeX.

 -- User Option: TeX-DVI-via-PDFTeX
     If this is set, DVI will also be produced by calling PDFTeX,
     setting '\pdfoutput=0'.  This makes it possible to use PDFTeX
     features like character protrusion even when producing DVI files.
     Contemporary TeX distributions do this anyway, so that you need not
     enable the option within AUCTeX.

 -- Command: TeX-interactive-mode
     ('C-c C-t C-i') This command toggles the interactive mode of
     AUCTeX, a global minor mode.  You can customize
     'TeX-interactive-mode' to give it a different default.  In
     interactive mode, TeX will pause with an error prompt when errors
     are encountered and wait for the user to type something.

 -- Command: TeX-source-correlate-mode
     ('C-c C-t C-s') Toggles support for forward and inverse search.
     Forward search refers to jumping to the place in the previewed
     document corresponding to where point is located in the document
     source and inverse search to the other way round.  *Note I/O
     Correlation::.

     You can permanently activate 'TeX-source-correlate-mode' by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-source-correlate-mode'.  There is a
     bunch of customization options for the mode, use 'M-x
     customize-group <RET> TeX-view <RET>' to find out more.

     AUCTeX is aware of three different means to do I/O correlation:
     source specials (only DVI output), the pdfsync LaTeX package (only
     PDF output) and SyncTeX.  The choice between source specials and
     SyncTeX can be controlled with the variable
     'TeX-source-correlate-method'.

     Should you use source specials it has to be stressed _very_
     strongly however, that source specials can cause differences in
     page breaks and spacing, can seriously interfere with various
     packages and should thus _never_ be used for the final version of a
     document.  In particular, fine-tuning the page breaks should be
     done with source specials switched off.

   AUCTeX also allows you to easily select different TeX engines for
processing, either by using the entries in the 'TeXing Options' submenu
below the 'Command' menu or by calling the function 'TeX-engine-set'.
These eventually set the variable 'TeX-engine' which you can also modify
directly.

 -- User Option: TeX-engine
     This variable allows you to choose which TeX engine should be used
     for typesetting the document, i.e.  the executables which will be
     used when you invoke the 'TeX' or 'LaTeX' commands.  The value
     should be one of the symbols defined in 'TeX-engine-alist-builtin'
     or 'TeX-engine-alist'.  The symbols 'default', 'xetex', 'luatex'
     and 'omega' are available from the built-in list.

   Note that 'TeX-engine' is buffer-local, so setting the variable
directly or via the above mentioned menu or function will not take
effect in other buffers.  If you want to activate an engine for all
AUCTeX modes, set 'TeX-engine' in your init file, e.g.  by using 'M-x
customize-variable <RET>'.  If you want to activate it for a certain
AUCTeX mode only, set the variable in the respective mode hook.  If you
want to activate it for certain files, set it through file variables
(*note (emacs)File Variables::).

   Should you need to change the executable names related to the
different engine settings, there are some variables you can tweak.
Those are 'TeX-command', 'LaTeX-command', 'TeX-Omega-command',
'LaTeX-Omega-command', 'ConTeXt-engine' and 'ConTeXt-Omega-engine'.  The
rest of the executables is defined directly in
'TeX-engine-alist-builtin'.  If you want to override an entry from that,
add an entry to 'TeX-engine-alist' that starts with the same symbol as
that the entry in the built-in list and specify the executables you want
to use instead.  You can also add entries to 'TeX-engine-alist' in order
to add support for engines not covered per default.

 -- User Option: TeX-engine-alist
     Alist of TeX engines and associated commands.  Each entry is a list
     with a maximum of five elements.  The first element is a symbol
     used to identify the engine.  The second is a string describing the
     engine.  The third is the command to be used for plain TeX. The
     fourth is the command to be used for LaTeX. The fifth is the
     command to be used for the '--engine' parameter of ConTeXt's
     'texexec' program.  Each command can either be a variable or a
     string.  An empty string or nil means there is no command
     available.

   As shown above, AUCTeX handles in a special way most of the main
options that can be given to the TeX processors.  When you need to pass
to the TeX processor arbitrary options not handled by AUCTeX, you can
use the file local variable 'TeX-command-extra-options'.
 -- User Option: TeX-command-extra-options
     String with the extra options to be given to the TeX processor.
     For example, if you need to enable the shell escape feature to
     compile a document, add the following line to the list of local
     variables of the source file:
          %%% TeX-command-extra-options: "-shell-escape"
     By default this option is not safe as a file-local variable because
     a specially crafted document compiled with shell escape enabled can
     be used for malicious purposes.

   You can customize AUCTeX to show the processor output as it is
produced.

 -- User Option: TeX-show-compilation
     If non-nil, the output of TeX compilation is shown in another
     window.

4.2 Viewing the Formatted Output
================================

AUCTeX allows you to start external programs for previewing the
formatted output of your document.

* Menu:

* Starting Viewers::            Starting viewers
* I/O Correlation::             Forward and inverse search


File: auctex.info,  Node: Starting Viewers,  Next: I/O Correlation,  Up: Viewing

4.2.1 Starting Viewers
----------------------

Viewers are normally invoked by pressing 'C-c C-c' once the document is
formatted, which will propose the View command, or by activating the
respective entry in the Command menu.  Alternatively you can type 'C-c
C-v' which calls the function 'TeX-view'.

 -- Command: TeX-view
     ('C-c C-v') Start a viewer without confirmation.  The viewer is
     started either on a region or the master file, depending on the
     last command issued.  This is especially useful for jumping to the
     location corresponding to point in the viewer when using
     'TeX-source-correlate-mode'.

   AUCTeX will try to guess which type of viewer (DVI, PostScript or
PDF) has to be used and what options are to be passed over to it.  This
decision is based on the output files present in the working directory
as well as the class and style options used in the document.  For
example, if there is a DVI file in your working directory, a DVI viewer
will be invoked.  In case of a PDF file it will be a PDF viewer.  If you
specified a special paper format like 'a5paper' or use the 'landscape'
option, this will be passed to the viewer by the appropriate options.
Especially some DVI viewers depend on this kind of information in order
to display your document correctly.  In case you are using 'pstricks' or
'psfrag' in your document, a DVI viewer cannot display the contents
correctly and a PostScript viewer will be invoked instead.

   The association between the tests for the conditions mentioned above
and the viewers is made in the variable 'TeX-view-program-selection'.
Therefore this variable is the starting point for customization if you
want to use other viewers than the ones suggested by default.

 -- User Option: TeX-view-program-selection
     This is a list of predicates and viewers which is evaluated from
     front to back in order to find out which viewer to call under the
     given conditions.  In the first element of each list item you can
     reference one or more predicates defined in
     'TeX-view-predicate-list' or 'TeX-view-predicate-list-builtin'.  In
     the second element you can reference a viewer defined in
     'TeX-view-program-list' or 'TeX-view-program-list-builtin'.  The
     viewer of the first item with a positively evaluated predicate is
     selected.

   So 'TeX-view-program-selection' only contains references to the
actual implementations of predicates and viewer commands respectively
which can be found elsewhere.  AUCTeX comes with a set of preconfigured
predicates and viewer commands which are stored in the variables
'TeX-view-predicate-list-builtin' and 'TeX-view-program-list-builtin'
respectively.  If you are not satisfied with those and want to overwrite
one of them or add your own definitions, you can do so via the variables
'TeX-view-predicate-list' and 'TeX-view-program-list'.

 -- User Option: TeX-view-predicate-list
     This is a list of predicates for viewer selection and invocation.
     The first element of each list item is a symbol and the second
     element a Lisp form to be evaluated.  The form should return nil if
     the predicate is not fulfilled.

     A built-in predicate from 'TeX-view-predicate-list-builtin' can be
     overwritten by defining a new predicate with the same symbol.

 -- User Option: TeX-view-program-list
     This is a list of viewer specifications each consisting of a
     symbolic name and either a command line or a function to be invoked
     when the viewer is called.  If a command line is used, parts of it
     can be conditionalized by prefixing them with predicates from
     'TeX-view-predicate-list' or 'TeX-view-predicate-list-builtin'.
     (See the doc string for the exact format to use.)  The command line
     can also contain placeholders as defined in 'TeX-expand-list' which
     are expanded before the viewer is called.

     A built-in viewer spec from 'TeX-view-program-list-builtin' can be
     overwritten by defining a new viewer spec with the same name.

   Note that the viewer selection and invocation as described above will
only work if certain default settings in AUCTeX are intact.  For one,
the whole viewer selection machinery will only be triggered if the '%V'
expander in 'TeX-expand-list' is unchanged.  So if you have trouble with
the viewer invocation you might check if there is an older customization
of the variable in place.  In addition, the use of a function in
'TeX-view-program-list' only works if the View command in
'TeX-command-list' makes use of the hook 'TeX-run-discard-or-function'.

   Note also that the implementation described above replaces an older
one which was less flexible.  This old implementation works with the
variables 'TeX-output-view-style' and 'TeX-view-style' which are used to
associate file types and style options with viewers.  If desired you can
reactivate it by using the placeholder '%vv' for the View command in
'TeX-command-list'.  Note however, that it is bound to be removed from
AUCTeX once the new implementation proved to be satisfactory.  For the
time being, find a short description of the mentioned customization
options below.

 -- User Option: TeX-output-view-style
     List of output file extensions, style options and view options.
     Each item of the list consists of three elements.  If the first
     element (a regular expression) matches the output file extension,
     and the second element (a regular expression) matches the name of
     one of the style options, any occurrence of the string '%V' in a
     command in 'TeX-command-list' will be replaced with the third
     element.

 -- User Option: TeX-view-style
     List of style options and view options.  This is the predecessor of
     'TeX-output-view-style' which does not provide the possibility to
     specify output file extensions.  It is used as a fallback in case
     none of the alternatives specified in 'TeX-output-view-style'
     match.  In case none of the entries in 'TeX-view-style' match
     either, no suggestion for a viewer is made.

4.2.2 Forward and Inverse Search
--------------------------------

Forward and inverse search refer to the correlation between the document
source in the editor and the typeset document in the viewer.  Forward
search allows you to jump to the place in the previewed document
corresponding to a certain line in the document source and inverse
search vice versa.

   AUCTeX supports three methods for forward and inverse search: source
specials (only DVI output), the pdfsync LaTeX package (only PDF output)
and SyncTeX (any type of output).  If you want to make use of forward
and inverse searching with source specials or SyncTeX, switch on
'TeX-source-correlate-mode'.  *Note Processor Options::, on how to do
that.  The use of the pdfsync package is detected automatically if
document parsing is enabled.  Customize the variable
'TeX-source-correlate-method' to select the method to use.

 -- User Option: TeX-source-correlate-method
     Method to use for enabling forward and inverse search.  This can be
     'source-specials' if source specials should be used, 'synctex' if
     SyncTeX should be used, or 'auto' if AUCTeX should decide.

     When the variable is set to 'auto', AUCTeX will always use SyncTeX
     if your 'latex' processor supports it, source specials otherwise.
     You must make sure your viewer supports the same method.

     It is also possible to specify a different method depending on the
     output, either DVI or PDF, by setting the variable to an alist of
     the kind
          ((dvi . <source-specials or synctex>)
           (pdf . <source-specials or synctex>))
     in which the CDR of each entry is a symbol specifying the method to
     be used in the corresponding mode.  The default value of the
     variable is
          ((dvi . source-specials)
           (pdf . synctex))
     which is compatible with the majority of viewers.

   Forward search happens automatically upon calling the viewer, e.g.
by typing 'C-c C-v' ('TeX-view').  This will open the viewer or bring it
to front and display the output page corresponding to the position of
point in the source file.  AUCTeX will automatically pass the necessary
command line options to the viewer for this to happen.

   Upon opening the viewer you will be asked if you want to start a
server process (Gnuserv or Emacs server) which is necessary for inverse
search.  This happens only if there is no server running already.  You
can customize the variable 'TeX-source-correlate-start-server' to
inhibit the question and always or never start the server respectively.

 -- User Option: TeX-source-correlate-start-server
     If 'TeX-source-correlate-mode' is active and a viewer is invoked,
     the default behavior is to ask if a server process should be
     started.  Set this variable to 't' if the question should be
     inhibited and the server should always be started.  Set it to 'nil'
     if the server should never be started.  Inverse search will not be
     available in the latter case.

   Inverse search, i.e.  jumping to the part of your document source in
Emacs corresponding to a certain position in the viewer, is triggered
from the viewer, typically by a mouse click.  Refer to the documentation
of your viewer to find out how it has to be configured and what you have
to do exactly.  In xdvi you normally have to use 'C-down-mouse-1'.

4.3 Catching the errors
=======================

Once you've formatted your document you may 'debug' it, i.e.  browse
through the errors (La)TeX reported.

 -- Command: TeX-next-error ARG REPARSE
     ('C-c `') Go to the next error reported by TeX.  The view will be
     split in two, with the cursor placed as close as possible to the
     error in the top view.  In the bottom view, the error message will
     be displayed along with some explanatory text.

     An optional numeric ARG, positive or negative, specifies how many
     error messages to move.  A negative ARG means to move back to
     previous error messages, see also 'TeX-previous-error'.

     The optional REPARSE argument makes AUCTeX reparse the error
     message buffer and start the debugging from the first error.  This
     can also be achieved by calling the function with a prefix argument
     ('C-u').

 -- Command: TeX-previous-error ARG
     ('M-g p') Go to the previous error reported by TeX.  An optional
     numeric ARG specifies how many error messages to move backward.
     This is like calling 'TeX-next-error' with a negative argument.

   The command 'TeX-previous-error' works only if AUCTeX can parse the
whole TeX log buffer.  This is controlled by the 'TeX-parse-all-errors'
variable.

 -- User Option: TeX-parse-all-errors
     If t, AUCTeX automatically parses the whole output log buffer right
     after running a TeX command, in order to collect all warnings and
     errors.  This makes it possible to navigate back and forth between
     the error messages using 'TeX-next-error' and 'TeX-previous-error'.
     This is the default.  If nil, AUCTeX does not parse the whole
     output log buffer and 'TeX-previous-error' cannot be used.

   Normally AUCTeX will only report real errors, but you may as well ask
it to report 'bad boxes' and warnings as well.

 -- Command: TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes
     ('C-c C-t C-b') Toggle whether AUCTeX should stop at bad boxes
     (i.e.  overfull and underfull boxes) as well as normal errors.

 -- Command: TeX-toggle-debug-warnings
     ('C-c C-t C-w') Toggle whether AUCTeX should stop at warnings as
     well as normal errors.

   As default, AUCTeX will display a special help buffer containing the
error reported by TeX along with the documentation.  There is however an
'expert' option, which allows you to display the real TeX output.

 -- User Option: TeX-display-help
     If t AUCTeX will automatically display a help text whenever an
     error is encountered using 'TeX-next-error' ('C-c `').  If nil a
     terse information about the error is displayed in the echo area.
     If 'expert' AUCTeX will display the output buffer with the raw TeX
     output.

   When the option 'TeX-parse-all-errors' is non-nil, you will be also
able to open an overview of all errors and warnings reported by the TeX
compiler.  This feature requires 'tabulated-list-mode', shipped with GNU
Emacs 24 or later.

 -- Command: TeX-error-overview
     Show an overview of the errors and warnings occurred in the last
     TeX run.

     In this window you can visit the error on which point is on by
     pressing <RET>, and visit the next or previous issue by pressing
     <n> or <p> respectively.  A prefix argument to these keys specifies
     how many errors to move forward or backward.  You can visit an
     error also by clicking on its message.  Press <q> to quit the
     overview.

 -- User Option: TeX-error-overview-open-after-TeX-run
     When this boolean variable is non-nil, the error overview will be
     automatically opened after running TeX if there are errors or
     warnings to show.

   The error overview is opened in a new window of the current frame by
default, but you can change this behavior by customizing the option
'TeX-error-overview-setup'.

 -- User Option: TeX-error-overview-setup
     Controls the frame setup of the error overview.  The possible value
     is: 'separate-frame'; with a nil value the current frame is used
     instead.

     The parameters of the separate frame can be set with the
     'TeX-error-overview-frame-parameters' option.

     If the display does not support multi frame, the current frame will
     be used regardless of the value of this variable.

4.4 Checking for problems
=========================

Running TeX or LaTeX will only find regular errors in the document, not
examples of bad style.  Furthermore, description of the errors may often
be confusing.  The utilities 'lacheck' and 'chktex' can be used to find
style errors, such as forgetting to escape the space after an
abbreviation or using '...' instead of '\ldots' and other similar
problems.  You start 'lacheck' with 'C-c C-c Check <RET>' and 'chktex'
with 'C-c C-c ChkTeX <RET>'.  The result will be a list of errors in the
'*compilation*' buffer.  You can go through the errors with 'C-x `'
('next-error', *note (emacs)Compilation::), which will move point to the
location of the next error.

   Each of the two utilities will find some errors the other doesn't,
but 'chktex' is more configurable, allowing you to create your own
errors.  You may need to install the programs before using them.  You
can get 'lacheck' from
'<URL:ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/lacheck/>' and 'chktex'
from '<URL:ftp://ftp.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/chktex/>'.

4.5 Controlling the output
==========================

A number of commands are available for controlling the output of an
application running under AUCTeX

 -- Command: TeX-kill-job
     ('C-c C-k') Kill currently running external application.  This may
     be either of TeX, LaTeX, previewer, BibTeX, etc.

 -- Command: TeX-recenter-output-buffer
     ('C-c C-l') Recenter the output buffer so that the bottom line is
     visible.

 -- Command: TeX-home-buffer
     ('C-c ^') Go to the 'master' file in the document associated with
     the current buffer, or if already there, to the file where the
     current process was started.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Cleaning,  Next: Documentation,  Prev: Control,  Up: Processing

4.6 Cleaning intermediate and output files
==========================================

 -- Command: TeX-clean
     Remove generated intermediate files.  In case a prefix argument is
     given, remove output files as well.

     Canonical access to the function is provided by the 'Clean' and
     'Clean All' entries in 'TeX-command-list', invokable with 'C-c C-c'
     or the Command menu.

     The patterns governing which files to remove can be adapted
     separately for each AUCTeX mode by means of the variables
     'plain-TeX-clean-intermediate-suffixes',
     'plain-TeX-clean-output-suffixes',
     'LaTeX-clean-intermediate-suffixes', 'LaTeX-clean-output-suffixes',
     'docTeX-clean-intermediate-suffixes',
     'docTeX-clean-output-suffixes',
     'Texinfo-clean-intermediate-suffixes',
     'Texinfo-clean-output-suffixes',
     'ConTeXt-clean-intermediate-suffixes' and
     'ConTeXt-clean-output-suffixes'.

 -- User Option: TeX-clean-confirm
     Control if deletion of intermediate and output files has to be
     confirmed before it is actually done.  If non-nil, ask before
     deleting files.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Documentation,  Prev: Cleaning,  Up: Processing

4.7 Documentation about macros and packages
===========================================

 -- Command: TeX-doc
     ('C-c ?') Get documentation about macros, packages or TeX & Co.  in
     general.  The function will prompt for the name of a command or
     manual, providing a list of available keywords for completion.  If
     point is on a command or word with available documentation, this
     will be suggested as default.

     In case no documentation could be found, a prompt for querying the
     'texdoc' program is shown, should the latter be available.

     The command can be invoked by the key binding mentioned above as
     well as the 'Find Documentation...' entry in the mode menu.

5.1 Modes and Hooks
===================

AUCTeX supports a wide variety of derivatives and extensions of TeX.
Besides plain TeX those are LaTeX, AMS-TeX, ConTeXt, Texinfo and docTeX.
For each of them there is a separate major mode in AUCTeX and each major
mode runs 'text-mode-hook', 'TeX-mode-hook' as well as a hook special to
the mode in this order.  The following table provides an overview of the
respective mode functions and hooks.

Type        Mode function      Hook
-------------------------------------------------------
Plain TeX   'plain-TeX-mode'   'plain-TeX-mode-hook'
LaTeX       'LaTeX-mode'       'LaTeX-mode-hook'
AMS-TeX     'ams-tex-mode'     'AmS-TeX-mode-hook'
ConTeXt     'ConTeXt-mode'     'ConTeXt-mode-hook'
Texinfo     'Texinfo-mode'     'Texinfo-mode-hook'
DocTeX      'docTeX-mode'      'docTeX-mode-hook'

   If you need to make a customization via a hook which is only relevant
for one of the modes listed above, put it into the respective mode hook,
if it is relevant for any AUCTeX mode, add it to 'TeX-mode-hook' and if
it is relevant for all text modes, append it to 'text-mode-hook'.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Multifile,  Next: Parsing Files,  Prev: Modes and Hooks,  Up: Customization

5.2 Multifile Documents
=======================

You may wish to spread a document over many files (as you are likely to
do if there are multiple authors, or if you have not yet discovered the
power of the outline commands (*note Outline::)).  This can be done by
having a "master" file in which you include the various files with the
TeX macro '\input' or the LaTeX macro '\include'.  These files may also
include other files themselves.  However, to format the document you
must run the commands on the top level master file.

   When you, for example, ask AUCTeX to run a command on the master
file, it has no way of knowing the name of the master file.  By default,
it will assume that the current file is the master file.  If you insert
the following in your '.emacs' file AUCTeX will use a more advanced
algorithm.

     (setq-default TeX-master nil) ; Query for master file.

   If AUCTeX finds the line indicating the end of the header in a master
file ('TeX-header-end'), it can figure out for itself that this is a
master file.  Otherwise, it will ask for the name of the master file
associated with the buffer.  To avoid asking you again, AUCTeX will
automatically insert the name of the master file as a file variable
(*note (emacs)File Variables::).  You can also insert the file variable
yourself, by putting the following text at the end of your files.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-master: "master"
     %%% End:

   You should always set this variable to the name of the top level
document.  If you always use the same name for your top level documents,
you can set 'TeX-master' in your '.emacs' file.

     (setq-default TeX-master "master") ; All master files called "master".

 -- User Option: TeX-master
     The master file associated with the current buffer.  If the file
     being edited is actually included from another file, then you can
     tell AUCTeX the name of the master file by setting this variable.
     If there are multiple levels of nesting, specify the top level
     file.

     If this variable is 'nil', AUCTeX will query you for the name.

     If the variable is 't', then AUCTeX will assume the file is a
     master file itself.

     If the variable is 'shared', then AUCTeX will query for the name,
     but will not change the file.

 -- User Option: TeX-one-master
     Regular expression matching ordinary TeX files.

     You should set this variable to match the name of all files, for
     which it is a good idea to append a 'TeX-master' file variable
     entry automatically.  When AUCTeX adds the name of the master file
     as a file variable, it does not need to ask next time you edit the
     file.

     If you dislike AUCTeX automatically modifying your files, you can
     set this variable to '"<none>"'.  By default, AUCTeX will modify
     any file with an extension of '.tex'.

 -- Command: TeX-master-file-ask
     ('C-c _') Query for the name of a master file and add the
     respective File Variables (*note (emacs)File Variables::) to the
     file for setting this variable permanently.

     AUCTeX will not ask for a master file when it encounters existing
     files.  This function shall give you the possibility to insert the
     variable manually.

   AUCTeX keeps track of macros, environments, labels, and style files
that are used in a given document.  For this to work with multifile
documents, AUCTeX has to have a place to put the information about the
files in the document.  This is done by having an 'auto' subdirectory
placed in the directory where your document is located.  Each time you
save a file, AUCTeX will write information about the file into the
'auto' directory.  When you load a file, AUCTeX will read the
information in the 'auto' directory about the file you loaded _and the
master file specified by 'TeX-master'_.  Since the master file (perhaps
indirectly) includes all other files in the document, AUCTeX will get
information from all files in the document.  This means that you will
get from each file, for example, completion for all labels defined
anywhere in the document.

   AUCTeX will create the 'auto' directory automatically if
'TeX-auto-save' is non-nil.  Without it, the files in the document will
not know anything about each other, except for the name of the master
file.  *Note Automatic Local::.

 -- Command: TeX-save-document
     ('C-c C-d') Save all buffers known to belong to the current
     document.

 -- User Option: TeX-save-query
     If non-nil, then query the user before saving each file with
     'TeX-save-document'.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Parsing Files,  Next: Internationalization,  Prev: Multifile,  Up: Customization

5.3 Automatic Parsing of TeX Files
==================================

AUCTeX depends heavily on being able to extract information from the
buffers by parsing them.  Since parsing the buffer can be somewhat slow,
the parsing is initially disabled.  You are encouraged to enable them by
adding the following lines to your '.emacs' file.

     (setq TeX-parse-self t) ; Enable parse on load.
     (setq TeX-auto-save t) ; Enable parse on save.

   The latter command will make AUCTeX store the parsed information in
an 'auto' subdirectory in the directory each time the TeX files are
stored, *note Automatic Local::.  If AUCTeX finds the pre-parsed
information when loading a file, it will not need to reparse the buffer.
The information in the 'auto' directory is also useful for multifile
documents, *note Multifile::, since it allows each file to access the
parsed information from all the other files in the document.  This is
done by first reading the information from the master file, and then
recursively the information from each file stored in the master file.

   The variables can also be done on a per file basis, by changing the
file local variables.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-parse-self: t
     %%% TeX-auto-save: t
     %%% End:

   Even when you have disabled the automatic parsing, you can force the
generation of style information by pressing 'C-c C-n'.  This is often
the best choice, as you will be able to decide when it is necessary to
reparse the file.

 -- User Option: TeX-parse-self
     Parse file after loading it if no style hook is found for it.

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-save
     Automatically save style information when saving the buffer.

 -- Command: TeX-normal-mode ARG
     ('C-c C-n') Remove all information about this buffer, and apply the
     style hooks again.  Save buffer first including style information.
     With optional argument, also reload the style hooks.

   When AUCTeX saves your buffer, it can optionally convert all tabs in
your buffer into spaces.  Tabs confuse AUCTeX's error message parsing
and so should generally be avoided.  However, tabs are significant in
some environments, and so by default AUCTeX does not remove them.  To
convert tabs to spaces when saving a buffer, insert the following in
your '.emacs' file:

     (setq TeX-auto-untabify t)

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-untabify
     Automatically remove all tabs from a file before saving it.

   Instead of disabling the parsing entirely, you can also speed it
significantly up by limiting the information it will search for (and
store) when parsing the buffer.  You can do this by setting the default
values for the buffer local variables 'TeX-auto-regexp-list' and
'TeX-auto-parse-length' in your '.emacs' file.

     ;; Only parse LaTeX class and package information.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-regexp-list 'LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list)
     ;; The class and package information is usually near the beginning.
     (setq-default TeX-auto-parse-length 2000)

   This example will speed the parsing up significantly, but AUCTeX will
no longer be able to provide completion for labels, macros,
environments, or bibitems specified in the document, nor will it know
what files belong to the document.

   These variables can also be specified on a per file basis, by
changing the file local variables.

     %%% Local Variables:
     %%% TeX-auto-regexp-list: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     %%% TeX-auto-parse-length: 999999
     %%% End:

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions used for parsing the current file.

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-parse-length
     Maximal length of TeX file that will be parsed.

   The pre-specified lists of regexps are defined below.  You can use
these before loading AUCTeX by quoting them, as in the example above.

 -- Constant: TeX-auto-empty-regexp-list
     Parse nothing

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-minimal-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX class and packages.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-label-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX labels.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-index-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX index and glossary entries.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-class-regexp-list
     Only parse macros in LaTeX classes and packages.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-pagestyle-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX pagestyles.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-counter-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX counters.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-length-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX lengths.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-savebox-regexp-list
     Only parse LaTeX saveboxes.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common LaTeX commands.

 -- Constant: plain-TeX-auto-regexp-list
     Parse common plain TeX commands.

 -- Constant: TeX-auto-full-regexp-list
     Parse all TeX and LaTeX commands that AUCTeX can use.

5.4 Language Support
====================

TeX and Emacs are usable for European (Latin, Cyrillic, Greek) based
languages.  Some LaTeX and EmacsLisp packages are available for easy
typesetting and editing documents in European languages.

   For CJK (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean) languages, Emacs or XEmacs
with MULE (MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs) support is required.
MULE is part of Emacs by default since Emacs 20.  XEmacs has to be
configured with the '--with-mule' option.  Special versions of TeX are
needed for CJK languages: CTeX and ChinaTeX for Chinese, ASCII pTeX and
NTT jTeX for Japanese, HLaTeX and kTeX for Korean.  The CJK-LaTeX
package is required for supporting multiple CJK scripts within a single
document.

   Note that Unicode is not fully supported in Emacs 21 and XEmacs 21.
CJK characters are not usable.  Please use the MULE-UCS EmacsLisp
package or Emacs 22 (not released yet) if you need CJK.

5.4.1 Using AUCTeX with European Languages
------------------------------------------

5.4.1.1 Typing and Displaying Non-ASCII Characters
..................................................

First you will need a way to write non-ASCII characters.  You can either
use macros, or teach TeX about the ISO character sets.  I prefer the
latter, it has the advantage that the usual standard emacs word movement
and case change commands will work.

   With LaTeX2e, just add '\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}'.  Other
languages than Western European ones will probably have other encoding
needs.

   To be able to display non-ASCII characters you will need an
appropriate font and a version of GNU Emacs capable of displaying 8-bit
characters (e.g.  Emacs 21).  The manner in which this is supported
differs between Emacsen, so you need to take a look at your respective
documentation.

   A compromise is to use an European character set when editing the
file, and convert to TeX macros when reading and writing the files.

'iso-cvt.el'
     Much like 'iso-tex.el' but is bundled with Emacs 19.23 and later.

'x-compose.el'
     Similar package bundled with new versions of XEmacs.

'X-Symbol'
     a much more complete package for both Emacs and XEmacs that can
     also handle a lot of mathematical characters and input methods.

5.4.1.2 Style Files for Different Languages
...........................................

AUCTeX supports style files for several languages.  Each style file may
modify AUCTeX to better support the language, and will run a language
specific hook that will allow you to for example change ispell
dictionary, or run code to change the keyboard remapping.  The following
will for example choose a Danish dictionary for documents including
'\usepackage[danish]{babel}'.  This requires parsing to be enabled,
*note Parsing Files::.

     (add-hook 'TeX-language-dk-hook
     	  (lambda () (ispell-change-dictionary "danish")))

   The following style files are recognized:

'bulgarian'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-bg-hook'.  Gives '"' word syntax,
     makes the <"> key insert a literal '"'.  Typing <"> twice will
     insert insert '"`' or '"'' depending on context.  Typing <-> twice
     will insert '"=', three times '--'.

'czech'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-cz-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     '\uv{' and '}' depending on context.

'danish'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-dk-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     '"`' and '"'' depending on context.  Typing <-> twice will insert
     '"=', i.e.  a hyphen string allowing hyphenation in the composing
     words.

'dutch'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-nl-hook'.

'english'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-en-hook'.

'frenchb'
'francais'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-fr-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     '\\og' and '\\fg' depending on context.  Note that the language
     name for customizing 'TeX-quote-language-alist' is 'french'.

'german'
'ngerman'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-de-hook'.  Gives '"' word syntax,
     makes the <"> key insert a literal '"'.  Pressing the key twice
     will give you opening or closing German quotes ('"`' or '"'').
     Typing <-> twice will insert '"=', three times '--'.

'icelandic'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-is-hook'.  Gives '"' word syntax,
     makes the <"> key insert a literal '"'.  Typing <"> twice will
     insert insert '"`' or '"'' depending on context.  Typing <-> twice
     will insert '"=', three times '--'.

'italian'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-it-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     '"<' and '">' depending on context.

'polish'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-pl-hook'.  Gives '"' word syntax and
     makes the <"> key insert a literal '"'.  Pressing <"> twice will
     insert '"`' or '"'' depending on context.

'polski'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-pl-hook'.  Makes the <"> key insert a
     literal '"'.  Pressing <"> twice will insert ',,' or '''' depending
     on context.

'slovak'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-sk-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     '\uv{' and '}' depending on context.

'swedish'
     Runs style hook 'TeX-language-sv-hook'.  Pressing <"> will insert
     ''''.  Typing <-> twice will insert '"=', three times '--'.

   Replacement of language-specific hyphen strings like '"=' with dashes
does not require to type <-> three times in a row.  You can put point
after the hypen string anytime and trigger the replacement by typing
<->.

   In case you are not satisfied with the suggested behavior of quote
and hyphen insertion you can change it by customizing the variables
'TeX-quote-language-alist' and 'LaTeX-babel-hyphen-language-alist'
respectively.

 -- User Option: TeX-quote-language-alist
     Used for overriding the default language-specific quote insertion
     behavior.  This is an alist where each element is a list consisting
     of four items.  The first item is the name of the language in
     concern as a string.  See the list of supported languages above.
     The second item is the opening quotation mark.  The third item is
     the closing quotation mark.  Opening and closing quotation marks
     can be specified directly as strings or as functions returning a
     string.  The fourth item is a boolean controlling quote insertion.
     It should be non-nil if if the special quotes should only be used
     after inserting a literal '"' character first, i.e.  on second key
     press.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-babel-hyphen-language-alist
     Used for overriding the behavior of hyphen insertion for specific
     languages.  Every element in this alist is a list of three items.
     The first item should specify the affected language as a string.
     The second item denotes the hyphen string to be used as a string.
     The third item, a boolean, controls the behavior of hyphen
     insertion and should be non-nil if the special hyphen should be
     inserted after inserting a literal '-' character, i.e.  on second
     key press.

   The defaults of hyphen insertion are defined by the variables
'LaTeX-babel-hyphen' and 'LaTeX-babel-hyphen-after-hyphen' respectively.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-babel-hyphen
     String to be used when typing <->.  This usually is a hyphen
     alternative or hyphenation aid provided by 'babel' and the related
     language style files, like '"=', '"~' or '"-'.

     Set it to an empty string or nil in order to disable
     language-specific hyphen insertion.

 -- User Option: LaTeX-babel-hyphen-after-hyphen
     Control insertion of hyphen strings.  If non-nil insert normal
     hyphen on first key press and swap it with the language-specific
     hyphen string specified in the variable 'LaTeX-babel-hyphen' on
     second key press.  If nil do it the other way round.

5.4.2 Using AUCTeX with Japanese TeX
------------------------------------

To write Japanese text with AUCTeX, you need to have versions of TeX and
Emacs that support Japanese.  There exist at least two variants of TeX
for Japanese text (NTT jTeX and ASCII pTeX).  AUCTeX can be used with
MULE (MULtilingual Enhancement to GNU Emacs) supported Emacsen.

   To use the Japanese TeX variants, simply activate
'japanese-plain-tex-mode' or 'japanese-latex-mode' and everything should
work.  If not, send mail to Masayuki Ataka
'<ataka@milk.freemail.ne.jp>', who kindly donated the code for
supporting Japanese in AUCTeX.  None of the primary AUCTeX maintainers
understand Japanese, so they cannot help you.

   If you usually use AUCTeX in Japanese, setting the following
variables is useful.

 -- User Option: TeX-default-mode
     Mode to enter for a new file when it cannott be determined whether
     the file is plain TeX or LaTeX or what.

     If you want to enter Japanese LaTeX mode whenever this may happen,
     set the variable like this:
          (setq TeX-default-mode 'japanese-latex-mode)

 -- User Option: japanese-TeX-command-default
     The default command for 'TeX-command' in Japanese TeX mode.

     The default value is '"pTeX"'.

 -- User Option: japanese-LaTeX-command-default
     The default command for 'TeX-command' in Japanese LaTeX mode.

     The default value is '"LaTeX"'.

 -- User Option: japanese-LaTeX-default-style
     The default style/class when creating a new Japanese LaTeX
     document.

     The default value is '"jarticle"'.

   See 'tex-jp.el' for more information.

5.5 Automatic Customization
===========================

Since AUCTeX is so highly customizable, it makes sense that it is able
to customize itself.  The automatic customization consists of scanning
TeX files and extracting symbols, environments, and things like that.

   The automatic customization is done on three different levels.  The
global level is the level shared by all users at your site, and consists
of scanning the standard TeX style files, and any extra styles added
locally for all users on the site.  The private level deals with those
style files you have written for your own use, and use in different
documents.  You may have a '~/lib/TeX/' directory where you store useful
style files for your own use.  The local level is for a specific
directory, and deals with writing customization for the files for your
normal TeX documents.

   If compared with the environment variable 'TEXINPUTS', the global
level corresponds to the directories built into TeX.  The private level
corresponds to the directories you add yourself, except for '.', which
is the local level.

* Menu:

* Automatic Global::            Automatic Customization for the Site
* Automatic Private::           Automatic Customization for a User
* Automatic Local::             Automatic Customization for a Directory

   By default AUCTeX will search for customization files in all the
global, private, and local style directories, but you can also set the
path directly.  This is useful if you for example want to add another
person's style hooks to your path.  Please note that all matching files
found in 'TeX-style-path' are loaded, and all hooks defined in the files
will be executed.

 -- User Option: TeX-style-path
     List of directories to search for AUCTeX style files.  Each must
     end with a slash.

   By default, when AUCTeX searches a directory for files, it will
recursively search through subdirectories.

 -- User Option: TeX-file-recurse
     Whether to search TeX directories recursively: nil means do not
     recurse, a positive integer means go that far deep in the directory
     hierarchy, t means recurse indefinitely.

   By default, AUCTeX will ignore files named '.', '..', 'SCCS', 'RCS',
and 'CVS'.

 -- User Option: TeX-ignore-file
     Regular expression matching file names to ignore.

     These files or directories will not be considered when searching
     for TeX files in a directory.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Automatic Global,  Next: Automatic Private,  Up: Automatic

5.5.1 Automatic Customization for the Site
------------------------------------------

Assuming that the automatic customization at the global level was done
when AUCTeX was installed, your choice is now: will you use it?  If you
use it, you will benefit by having access to all the symbols and
environments available for completion purposes.  The drawback is slower
load time when you edit a new file and perhaps too many confusing
symbols when you try to do a completion.

   You can disable the automatic generated global style hooks by setting
the variable 'TeX-auto-global' to nil.

 -- User Option: TeX-macro-global
     Directories containing the site's TeX style files.

 -- User Option: TeX-style-global
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end with
     a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros shared by all users of a site.

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-global
     Directory containing automatically generated information.

     For storing automatic extracted information about the TeX macros
     shared by all users of a site.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Automatic Private,  Next: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Global,  Up: Automatic

5.5.2 Automatic Customization for a User
----------------------------------------

You should specify where you store your private TeX macros, so AUCTeX
can extract their information.  The extracted information will go to the
directories listed in 'TeX-auto-private'

   Use 'M-x TeX-auto-generate <RET>' to extract the information.

 -- User Option: TeX-macro-private
     Directories where you store your personal TeX macros.  The value
     defaults to the directories listed in the 'TEXINPUTS' and
     'BIBINPUTS' environment variables or to the respective directories
     in '$TEXMFHOME' if no results can be obtained from the environment
     variables.

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-private
     List of directories containing automatically generated AUCTeX style
     files.  These correspond to the personal TeX macros.

 -- Command: TeX-auto-generate TEX AUTO
     ('M-x TeX-auto-generate <RET>') Generate style hook for TEX and
     store it in AUTO.  If TEX is a directory, generate style hooks for
     all files in the directory.

 -- User Option: TeX-style-private
     List of directories containing hand generated AUCTeX style files.
     These correspond to the personal TeX macros.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Automatic Local,  Prev: Automatic Private,  Up: Automatic

5.5.3 Automatic Customization for a Directory
---------------------------------------------

AUCTeX can update the style information about a file each time you save
it, and it will do this if the directory 'TeX-auto-local' exist.
'TeX-auto-local' is by default set to '"auto"', so simply creating an
'auto' directory will enable automatic saving of style information.

   The advantage of doing this is that macros, labels, etc.  defined in
any file in a multifile document will be known in all the files in the
document.  The disadvantage is that saving will be slower.  To disable,
set 'TeX-auto-local' to nil.

 -- User Option: TeX-style-local
     Directory containing hand generated TeX information.  Must end with
     a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

 -- User Option: TeX-auto-local
     Directory containing automatically generated TeX information.  Must
     end with a slash.

     These correspond to TeX macros found in the current directory.

global, private, and local style files.  The hand generated style files

File: auctex.info,  Node: Simple Style,  Next: Adding Macros,  Up: Style Files

5.6.1 A Simple Style File
-------------------------

Here is a simple example of a style file.

     ;;; book.el - Special code for book style.

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "book"
      (lambda ()
        (LaTeX-largest-level-set "chapter"))
      LaTeX-dialect)

   The example is from the AUCTeX sources and is loaded for any LaTeX
document using the book document class (or style before LaTeX2e).  The
file specifies that the largest kind of section in such a document is
chapter.  The interesting thing to notice is that the style file defines
an (anonymous) function, and adds it to the list of loaded style hooks
by calling 'TeX-add-style-hook'.

   The first time the user indirectly tries to access some
style-specific information, such as the largest sectioning command
available, the style hooks for all files directly or indirectly read by
the current document are executed.  The actual files will only be
evaluated once, but the hooks will be called for each buffer using the
style file.

   Note that the basename of the style file and the name of the style
hook should usually be identical.

 -- Function: TeX-add-style-hook STYLE HOOK &optional DIALECT-EXPR
     Add HOOK to the list of functions to run when we use the TeX file
     STYLE and the current dialect is one in the set derived from
     DIALECT-EXPR.  When DIALECT-EXPR is omitted, then HOOK is allowed
     to be run whatever the current dialect is.

     DIALECT-EXPR may be one of:

        * A symbol indicating a singleton containing one basic TeX
          dialect, this symbol shall be selected among:
          ':latex'
               For all files in LaTeX mode, or any mode derived thereof
          ':bibtex'
               For all files in BibTeX mode, or any mode derived thereof
          ':texinfo'
               For all files in Texinfo mode.
        * A logical expression like:
          '(or DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 ... DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N)'
               For union of the sets of dialects corresponding to
               DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 through DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N
          '(and DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 ... DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N)'
               For intersection of the sets of dialects corresponding to
               DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 through DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N
          '(nor DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 ... DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N)'
               For complement of the union sets of dialects
               corresponding to DIALECT-EXPRESSION1 through
               DIALECT-EXPRESSION_N relatively to the set of all
               supported dialects
          '(not DIALECT-EXPR)'
               For complement set of dialect corresponding to
               DIALECT-EXPR relatively to the set of all supported
               dialects

   In case of adding a style hook for LaTeX, when calling function
'TeX-add-style-hook' it is thought more futureproof for argument
DIALECT-EXPR to pass constant 'LaTeX-dialect' currently defined to
':latex', rather than passing ':latex' directly.

 -- Constant: LaTeX-dialect
     Default dialect for use with function 'TeX-add-style-hook' for
     argument DIALECT-EXPR when the hook is to be run only on LaTeX
     file, or any mode derived thereof.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Adding Macros,  Next: Adding Environments,  Prev: Simple Style,  Up: Style Files

5.6.2 Adding Support for Macros
-------------------------------

The most common thing to define in a style hook is new symbols (TeX
macros).  Most likely along with a description of the arguments to the
function, since the symbol itself can be defined automatically.

   Here are a few examples from 'latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "latex"
      (lambda ()
        (TeX-add-symbols
         '("arabic" TeX-arg-counter)
         '("label" TeX-arg-define-label)
         '("ref" TeX-arg-ref)
         '("newcommand" TeX-arg-define-macro [ "Number of arguments" ] t)
         '("newtheorem" TeX-arg-define-environment
           [ TeX-arg-environment "Numbered like" ]
           t [ TeX-arg-counter "Within counter" ]))))

 -- Function: TeX-add-symbols SYMBOL ...
     Add each SYMBOL to the list of known symbols.

   Each argument to 'TeX-add-symbols' is a list describing one symbol.
The head of the list is the name of the symbol, the remaining elements
describe each argument.

   If there are no additional elements, the symbol will be inserted with
point inside braces.  Otherwise, each argument of this function should
match an argument of the TeX macro.  What is done depends on the
argument type.

   If a macro is defined multiple times, AUCTeX will chose the one with
the longest definition (i.e.  the one with the most arguments).

   Thus, to overwrite
     	'("tref" 1) ; one argument
   you can specify
     	'("tref" TeX-arg-ref ignore) ; two arguments

   'ignore' is a function that does not do anything, so when you insert
a 'tref' you will be prompted for a label and no more.

   You can use the following types of specifiers for arguments:

'string'
     Use the string as a prompt to prompt for the argument.

'number'
     Insert that many braces, leave point inside the first.  0 and -1
     are special.  0 means that no braces are inserted.  -1 means that
     braces are inserted around the macro and an active region (e.g.
     '{\tiny foo}').  If there is no active region, no braces are
     inserted.

'nil'
     Insert empty braces.

't'
     Insert empty braces, leave point between the braces.

'other symbols'
     Call the symbol as a function.  You can define your own hook, or
     use one of the predefined argument hooks.

'list'
     If the car is a string, insert it as a prompt and the next element
     as initial input.  Otherwise, call the car of the list with the
     remaining elements as arguments.

'vector'
     Optional argument.  If it has more than one element, parse it as a
     list, otherwise parse the only element as above.  Use square
     brackets instead of curly braces, and is not inserted on empty user
     input.

   A lot of argument hooks have already been defined.  The first
argument to all hooks is a flag indicating if it is an optional
argument.  It is up to the hook to determine what to do with the
remaining arguments, if any.  Typically the next argument is used to
overwrite the default prompt.

'TeX-arg-conditional'
     Implements if EXPR THEN ELSE. If EXPR evaluates to true, parse THEN
     as an argument list, else parse ELSE as an argument list.

'TeX-arg-literal'
     Insert its arguments into the buffer.  Used for specifying extra
     syntax for a macro.

'TeX-arg-free'
     Parse its arguments but use no braces when they are inserted.

'TeX-arg-eval'
     Evaluate arguments and insert the result in the buffer.

'TeX-arg-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  If RefTeX is
     active, prompt for the reference format.

'TeX-arg-ref'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  If RefTeX is
     active, do not prompt for the reference format.  Usually, reference
     macros should use this function instead of 'TeX-arg-label'.

'TeX-arg-index-tag'
     Prompt for an index tag.  This is the name of an index, not the
     entry.

'TeX-arg-index'
     Prompt for an index entry completing with known entries.

'TeX-arg-length'
     Prompt for a LaTeX length completing with known lengths.

'TeX-arg-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.

'TeX-arg-date'
     Prompt for a date, defaulting to the current date.  The format of
     the date is specified by the 'TeX-date-format' option.  If you want
     to change the format when the 'babel' package is loaded with a
     specific language, set 'TeX-date-format' inside the appropriate
     language hook, for details *note European::.

'TeX-arg-version'
     Prompt for the version of a file, using as initial input the
     current date.

'TeX-arg-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.

'TeX-arg-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.  If the variable
     'TeX-arg-cite-note-p' is non-nil, ask also for optional note in
     citations.

'TeX-arg-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter completing with known counters.

'TeX-arg-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox completing with known saveboxes.

'TeX-arg-file'
     Prompt for a filename in the current directory, and use it without
     the extension.

'TeX-arg-file-name'
     Prompt for a filename and use as initial input the name of the file
     being visited in the current buffer, with extension.

'TeX-arg-file-name-sans-extension'
     Prompt for a filename and use as initial input the name of the file
     being visited in the current buffer, without extension.

'TeX-arg-input-file'
     Prompt for the name of an input file in TeX's search path, and use
     it without the extension.  Run the style hooks for the file.  (Note
     that the behavior (type of prompt and inserted file name) of the
     function can be controlled by the variable
     'TeX-arg-input-file-search'.)

'TeX-arg-define-label'
     Prompt for a label completing with known labels.  Add label to list
     of defined labels.

'TeX-arg-define-length'
     Prompt for a LaTeX length completing with known lengths.  Add
     length to list of defined lengths.

'TeX-arg-define-macro'
     Prompt for a TeX macro with completion.  Add macro to list of
     defined macros.

'TeX-arg-define-environment'
     Prompt for a LaTeX environment with completion.  Add environment to
     list of defined environments.

'TeX-arg-define-cite'
     Prompt for a BibTeX citation.

'TeX-arg-define-counter'
     Prompt for a LaTeX counter.

'TeX-arg-define-savebox'
     Prompt for a LaTeX savebox.

'TeX-arg-document'
     Prompt for a LaTeX document class, using 'LaTeX-default-style' as
     default value and 'LaTeX-default-options' as default list of
     options.  If the variable 'TeX-arg-input-file-search' is t, you
     will be able to complete with all LaTeX classes available on your
     system, otherwise classes listed in the variable 'LaTeX-style-list'
     will be used for completion.  It is also provided completion for
     options of many common classes.

'LaTeX-arg-usepackage'
     Prompt for LaTeX packages.  If the variable
     'TeX-arg-input-file-search' is t, you will be able to complete with
     all LaTeX packages available on your system.  It is also provided
     completion for options of many common packages.

'TeX-arg-bibstyle'
     Prompt for a BibTeX style file completing with all style available
     on your system.

'TeX-arg-bibliography'
     Prompt for BibTeX database files completing with all databases
     available on your system.

'TeX-arg-corner'
     Prompt for a LaTeX side or corner position with completion.

     Insert x and y coordinates as a pair.  No arguments.

'LaTeX-arg-author'
     Prompt for document author, using 'LaTeX-default-author' as initial
     input.

'TeX-read-key-val'
     Prompt for a key=value list of options and return them.

'TeX-arg-key-val'
     Prompt for a key=value list of options and insert it as a TeX macro
     argument.

   If you add new hooks, you can assume that point is placed directly
after the previous argument, or after the macro name if this is the
first argument.  Please leave point located after the argument you are
inserting.  If you want point to be located somewhere else after all
hooks have been processed, set the value of 'exit-mark'.  It will point
nowhere, until the argument hook sets it.

   Some packages provide macros that are rarely useful to non-expert
users.  Those should be marked as expert macros using
'TeX-declare-expert-macros'.

 -- Function: TeX-declare-expert-macros STYLE MACROS...
     Declare MACROS as expert macros of STYLE.

     Expert macros are completed depending on
     'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

5.6.3 Adding Support for Environments
-------------------------------------

Adding support for environments is very much like adding support for TeX
macros, except that each environment normally only takes one argument,
an environment hook.  The example is again a short version of
'latex.el'.

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "latex"
      (lambda ()
        (LaTeX-add-environments
         '("document" LaTeX-env-document)
         '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-item)
         '("itemize" LaTeX-env-item)
         '("list" LaTeX-env-list))))

   It is completely up to the environment hook to insert the
environment, but the function 'LaTeX-insert-environment' may be of some
help.  The hook will be called with the name of the environment as its
first argument, and extra arguments can be provided by adding them to a
list after the hook.

   For simple environments with arguments, for example defined with
'\newenvironment', you can make AUCTeX prompt for the arguments by
giving the prompt strings in the call to 'LaTeX-add-environments'.  The
fact that an argument is optional can be indicated by wrapping the
prompt string in a vector.

   For example, if you have defined a 'loop' environment with the three
arguments FROM, TO, and STEP, you can add support for them in a style
file.

     %% loop.sty

     \newenvironment{loop}[3]{...}{...}

     ;; loop.el

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "loop"
      (lambda ()
        (LaTeX-add-environments
         '("loop" "From" "To" "Step"))))

   If an environment is defined multiple times, AUCTeX will choose the
one with the longest definition.  Thus, if you have an enumerate style
file, and want it to replace the standard LaTeX enumerate hook above,
you could define an 'enumerate.el' file as follows, and place it in the
appropriate style directory.

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "latex"
      (lambda ()
        (LaTeX-add-environments
         '("enumerate" LaTeX-env-enumerate foo))))

     (defun LaTeX-env-enumerate (environment &optional ignore) ...)

   The symbol 'foo' will be passed to 'LaTeX-env-enumerate' as the
second argument, but since we only added it to overwrite the definition
in 'latex.el' it is just ignored.

 -- Function: LaTeX-add-environments ENV ...
     Add each ENV to list of loaded environments.

 -- Function: LaTeX-insert-environment ENV [ EXTRA ]
     Insert environment of type ENV, with optional argument EXTRA.

   Following is a list of available hooks for 'LaTeX-add-environments':

'LaTeX-env-item'
     Insert the given environment and the first item.

'LaTeX-env-figure'
     Insert the given figure-like environment with a caption and a
     label.

'LaTeX-env-array'
     Insert the given array-like environment with position and column
     specifications.

'LaTeX-env-label'
     Insert the given environment with a label.

'LaTeX-env-list'
     Insert the given list-like environment, a specifier for the label
     and the first item.

'LaTeX-env-minipage'
     Insert the given minipage-like environment with position and width
     specifications.

'LaTeX-env-tabular*'
     Insert the given tabular*-like environment with width, position and
     column specifications.

'LaTeX-env-picture'
     Insert the given environment with width and height specifications.

'LaTeX-env-bib'
     Insert the given environment with a label for a bibitem.

'LaTeX-env-contents'
     Insert the given environment with a filename as its argument.

'LaTeX-env-args'
     Insert the given environment with arguments.  You can use this as a
     hook in case you want to specify multiple complex arguments just
     like in elements of 'TeX-add-symbols'.  This is most useful if the
     specification of arguments to be prompted for with strings and
     strings wrapped in a vector as described above is too limited.

     Here is an example from 'listings.el' which calls a function with
     one argument in order to prompt for a key=value list to be inserted
     as an optional argument of the 'lstlisting' environment:

          (LaTeX-add-environments
           '("lstlisting" LaTeX-env-args
             [TeX-arg-key-val LaTeX-listings-key-val-options]))

   Some packages provide environments that are rarely useful to
non-expert users.  Those should be marked as expert environments using
'LaTeX-declare-expert-environments'.

 -- Function: LaTeX-declare-expert-environments STYLE ENVIRONMENTS...
     Declare ENVIRONMENTS as expert environments of STYLE.

     Expert environments are completed depending on
     'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

5.6.4 Adding Other Information
------------------------------

You can also specify bibliographical databases and labels in the style
file.  This is probably of little use, since this information will
usually be automatically generated from the TeX file anyway.

 -- Function: LaTeX-add-bibliographies BIBLIOGRAPHY ...
     Add each BIBLIOGRAPHY to list of loaded bibliographies.

 -- Function: LaTeX-add-labels LABEL ...
     Add each LABEL to the list of known labels.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Hacking the Parser,  Prev: Adding Other,  Up: Style Files

5.6.5 Automatic Extraction of New Things
----------------------------------------

The automatic TeX information extractor works by searching for regular
expressions in the TeX files, and storing the matched information.  You
can add support for new constructs to the parser, something that is
needed when you add new commands to define symbols.

   For example, in the file 'macro.tex' I define the following macro.

     \newcommand{\newmacro}[5]{%
     \def#1{#3\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     \def#2{#5\index{#4@#5~cite{#4}}\nocite{#4}}%
     }

   AUCTeX will automatically figure out that 'newmacro' is a macro that
takes five arguments.  However, it is not smart enough to automatically
see that each time we use the macro, two new macros are defined.  We can
specify this information in a style hook file.

     ;;; macro.el --- Special code for my own macro file.

     ;;; Code:

     (defvar TeX-newmacro-regexp
       '("\\\\newmacro{\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}{\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\)}"
         (1 2) TeX-auto-multi)
       "Matches \newmacro definitions.")

     (defvar TeX-auto-multi nil
       "Temporary for parsing \\newmacro definitions.")

     (defun TeX-macro-cleanup ()
       "Move symbols from `TeX-auto-multi' to `TeX-auto-symbol'."
       (mapcar (lambda (list)
     	    (mapcar (lambda (symbol)
     		      (setq TeX-auto-symbol
     			    (cons symbol TeX-auto-symbol)))
     		    list))
     	  TeX-auto-multi))

     (defun TeX-macro-prepare ()
       "Clear `Tex-auto-multi' before use."
       (setq TeX-auto-multi nil))

     (add-hook 'TeX-auto-prepare-hook 'TeX-macro-prepare)
     (add-hook 'TeX-auto-cleanup-hook 'TeX-macro-cleanup)

     (TeX-add-style-hook
      "macro"
      (lambda ()
        (TeX-auto-add-regexp TeX-newmacro-regexp)
        (TeX-add-symbols '("newmacro"
     		      TeX-arg-macro
     		      (TeX-arg-macro "Capitalized macro: \\")
     		      t
     		      "BibTeX entry: "
     		      nil))))

     ;;; macro.el ends here

   When this file is first loaded, it adds a new entry to
'TeX-newmacro-regexp', and defines a function to be called before the
parsing starts, and one to be called after the parsing is done.  It also
declares a variable to contain the data collected during parsing.
Finally, it adds a style hook which describes the 'newmacro' macro, as
we have seen it before.

   So the general strategy is: Add a new entry to 'TeX-newmacro-regexp'.
Declare a variable to contain intermediate data during parsing.  Add
hook to be called before and after parsing.  In this case, the hook
before parsing just initializes the variable, and the hook after parsing
collects the data from the variable, and adds them to the list of
symbols found.

 -- Variable: TeX-auto-regexp-list
     List of regular expressions matching TeX macro definitions.

     The list has the following format ((REGEXP MATCH TABLE) ...), that
     is, each entry is a list with three elements.

     REGEXP. Regular expression matching the macro we want to parse.

     MATCH. A number or list of numbers, each representing one
     parenthesized subexpression matched by REGEXP.

     TABLE. The symbol table to store the data.  This can be a function,
     in which case the function is called with the argument MATCH. Use
     'TeX-match-buffer' to get match data.  If it is not a function, it
     is presumed to be the name of a variable containing a list of match
     data.  The matched data (a string if MATCH is a number, a list of
     strings if MATCH is a list of numbers) is put in front of the
     table.

 -- Variable: TeX-auto-prepare-hook nil
     List of functions to be called before parsing a TeX file.

 -- Variable: TeX-auto-cleanup-hook nil
     List of functions to be called after parsing a TeX file.

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.  We
     recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can
     be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You accept
     the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way
     requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
     notice that says that the Document is released under this License.
     If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it
     is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.  The Document may
     contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document does not identify
     any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed
     of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely
     available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text
     formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats
     suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise
     Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has
     been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
     readers is not Transparent.  An image format is not Transparent if
     used for any substantial amount of text.  A copy that is not
     "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming
     simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
     Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.
     Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and
     edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which
     the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and
     the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes copies
     of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the
     conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the title
     equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material on the
     covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as
     long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these
     conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
     Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with
     each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general
     network-using public has access to download using public-standard
     network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free
     of added material.  If you use the latter option, you must take
     reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque
     copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will
     remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
     year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
     through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies,
     to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
     Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the
     Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing
     distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever
     possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these things in
     the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous
          versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
          History section of the Document).  You may use the same title
          as a previous version if the original publisher of that
          version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the
          Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in the
          Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and
          publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
          an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the
          previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in the
          "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a work
          that was published at least four years before the Document
          itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers
          to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section
          all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered
          in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers or the
          equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate
     some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their
     titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's
     license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any other
     section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of
     the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage
     of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
     through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document
     already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added
     by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on
     behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old
     one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added
     the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all
     of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents
     in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
     License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
     document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a
     storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
     finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
     violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
     received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from
     that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days
     after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
     under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not
     permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the
     same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If the
     Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may
     choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free
     Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy can
     decide which future versions of this License can be used, that
     proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
     authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means any
     World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also
     provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works.  A
     public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server.
     A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC") contained in the
     site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC
     site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit
     corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco,
     California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license
     published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or
     in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts."  line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free
software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit
their use in free software.

A.2 Changes and New Features
============================

News in 11.88
=============

   * 'TeX-PDF-mode' is now enabled by default.

   * Now 'TeX-previous-error' works with TeX commands if the new option
     'TeX-parse-all-errors' is non-nil, which is the default.  When this
     option is non-nil, an overview of errors and warnings reported by
     the TeX compiler can be opened with 'M-x TeX-error-overview <RET>'.
     *Note Debugging::, for details.

   * Style file authors are encouraged to distinguish common from expert
     macros and environments, and mark the latter using
     'TeX-declare-expert-macros' and
     'LaTeX-declare-expert-environments'.

     Users can then restrict completion using
     'TeX-complete-expert-commands'.

   * Management of LaTeX package options in the parser was improved.
     You might need to reparse your documents, especially if you loaded
     the 'babel' package with language options.

   * Now you can insert '$...$' or '\(...\)' by typing a single '$'.  To
     do this, customize the new option 'TeX-electric-math'.
     'TeX-math-close-double-dollar' was removed.  *Note Quotes::, for
     details.

   * 'C-c <RET> documentclass <RET>' completes with all available LaTeX
     classes, if the 'TeX-arg-input-file-search' variable is non-nil.
     Completion for class options of the standard LaTeX classes is
     provided as well.

   * New user options 'LaTeX-default-author',
     'LaTeX-fontspec-arg-font-search',
     'LaTeX-fontspec-font-list-default', 'TeX-date-format', and
     'TeX-insert-braces-alist'.  A new possible value
     ('show-all-optional-args') for 'TeX-insert-macro-default-style' was
     added.  The default value of 'TeX-source-correlate-method' has been
     changed.

   * 'biblatex' support was greatly expanded.  If parsing is enabled,
     AUCTeX looks at 'backend' option to decide whether to use Biber or
     BibTeX. The 'LaTeX-biblatex-use-Biber' variable was changed to be
     file local only and is no more customizable.

   * With some LaTeX classes, the default environment suggested by
     'LaTeX-environment' ('C-c C-e') when the current environment is
     'document' was changed.  With 'beamer' class the default
     environment is 'frame', with 'letter' it is 'letter', with 'slides'
     it is 'slide'.

   * Brace pairing feature was enhanced in LaTeX documents.  Support for
     '\bigl', '\Bigl', '\biggl' and '\Biggl', the same as the one for
     '\left', was added to 'TeX-insert-macro'.  For example, 'C-c <RET>
     bigl <RET> ( <RET>' inserts '\bigl(\bigr)'.

     You can insert brace pair '()', '{}' and '[]' by typing a single
     left brace if the new user option 'LaTeX-electric-left-right-brace'
     is enabled.

     Macros '\langle', '\lfloor' and '\lceil', which produce the left
     part of the paired braces, are treated similarly as '(', '{' and
     '[' during the course of 'TeX-insert-macro'.  *Note Quotes::, for
     details.

   * Support for dozens of LaTeX packages was added.

   * Tabular-like environments (tabular, tabular*, tabularx, tabulary,
     array, align, ...)  are indented in a nicer and more informative
     way when the column values of a table line are written across
     multiple lines in the tex file.

   * The suitable number of ampersands are inserted when you insert
     array, tabular and tabular* environments with 'C-c C-e'.  Similar
     experience is obtained if you terminate rows in these environments
     with 'C-c <LFD>'.  It supplies line break macro '\\' and inserts
     the suitable number of ampersands on the next line.

     Similar supports are provided for various amsmath environments.

     *Note Tabular-like::, for details.

   * Commands for narrowing to a group ('TeX-narrow-to-group') and to
     LaTeX environments ('LaTeX-narrow-to-environment') were added.

   * Now arbitrary options can be passed to the TeX processor on a per
     file basis using the 'TeX-command-extra-options' option.  *Note
     Processor Options::, for details.

   * Now 'C-c C-e document <RET>', in an empty document, prompts for
     '\usepackage' macros in addition to '\documentclass'.

   * 'TeX-add-style-hook' has now a third argument to tell AUCTeX for
     which dialect (LaTeX, Texinfo or BibTeX) the style hook is
     registers.  Labelling style hook by dialect will avoid applying
     them not in the right context.

   * There have been lots of bug fixes and feature additions.

News since 11.87
================

   * AUCTeX now supports Biber in conjunction with biblatex in addition
     to BibTeX.

   * Each AUCTeX mode now has its own abbrev table.  On Emacsen which
     provide the possibility to inherit abbrevs from other tables, the
     abbrevs from the Text mode abbrev table are available as well.
     Newly defined abbrevs are written to the mode-specific tables,
     though.

   * The file 'tex-fptex.el' was removed.

   * Forward/backward search for Evince has been improved.  If Emacs is
     compiled with DBUS support and a recent Evince version (3.x) is
     installed, the communication goes over the desktop bus instead of
     the command line, resulting in more accurate positioning of point
     in Emacs and highlighting of the target paragraph in Evince.

   * A problem where Ghostscript threw an /invalidfileaccess error when
     running preview-latex was fixed.

   * A lot of smaller fixes and additions have been made.

News in 11.86
=============

   * Parsing of LaTeX output was improved.  It is now less likely that
     AUCTeX opens a non-existent file upon calling 'TeX-next-error'; a
     problem for example encountered when using MiKTeX 2.8.  In addition
     quoted file names as emitted by MiKTeX are now supported.

   * A new framework for the definition and selection of viewers was
     implemented.  If you have customizations regarding viewers you will
     have to redo them in this new framework or reenable the old one.
     *Note Starting Viewers::, for details.

   * Comprehensive editing support for PSTricks was added.

   * Support for various LaTeX packages was added, e.g.  'tabularx',
     'CJK', and 'hyperref'.

   * An easy way to switch between TeX engines (PDFTeX, LuaTeX, XeTeX,
     Omega) was added.

   * Support for SyncTeX was added.  This involves the command line
     options for LaTeX and the viewer.

   * Folding can now be customized to use macro arguments as replacement
     text.

   * 'preview.sty' now works with XeTeX.

   * A lot of smaller and larger bugs have been squashed.

News in 11.85
=============

   * Font locking has been improved significantly.  It is now less prone
     to color bleeding which could lead to high resource usage.  In
     addition it now includes information about LaTeX macro syntax and
     can indicate syntactically incorrect macros in LaTeX mode.

   * The license was updated to GPLv3.

   * Support for the nomencl, flashcards and comment LaTeX packages as
     well as the Icelandic language option of babel were added.

   * Support for folding of math macros was added.

   * Lots of minor bugs in features and documentation fixed.

News in 11.84
=============

   * There have been problems with the '-without-texmf-dir' option to
     'configure' when the value of '-with-kpathsea-sep' was set or
     determined for an installation system with a default different from
     that of the runtime system.  'with-kpathsea-sep' has been removed;
     the setting is now usually determined at runtime.

     Due to this and other problems, preview-latex in the released
     XEmacs package failed under Windows or with anything except recent
     21.5 XEmacsen.

   * AUCTeX and preview-latex have been changed in order to accommodate
     file names containing spaces.  preview-latex now tolerates bad
     PostScript code polluting the stack (like some Omega fonts).

   * 'preview.sty' had in some cases failed to emit PostScript header
     specials.

   * Support for folding of comments was added.

   * The 'polish' language option of the babel LaTeX package as well as
     the polski LaTeX package are now supported.  Most notably this
     means that AUCTeX will help to insert quotation marks as defined by
     polish.sty ('"`..."'') and polski.sty (',,...''').

   * The TeX tool bar is now available and enabled by default in plain
     TeX mode.  *Note Processing Facilities::.

   * Bug fix in the display of math subscripts and superscripts.

   * Bug fix 'TeX-doc' for Emacs 21.

   * There has been quite a number of other bug fixes to various
     features and documentation across the board.

News in 11.83
=============

   * The new function 'TeX-doc' provides easy access to documentation
     about commands and packages or information related to TeX and
     friends in general.  *Note Documentation::.

   * You can now get rid of generated intermediate and output files by
     means of the new 'Clean' and 'Clean All' entries in
     'TeX-command-list' accessible with 'C-c C-c' or the Command menu.
     *Note Cleaning::.

   * Support for forward search with PDF files was added.  That means
     you can jump to a place in the output file corresponding to the
     position in the source file.  *Note Viewing::.

     Adding support for this feature required the default value of the
     variable 'TeX-output-view-style' to be changed.  Please make sure
     you either remove any customizations overriding the new default or
     incorporate the changes into your customizations if you want to use
     this feature.

   * TeX error messages of the '-file-line-error' kind are now
     understood in AUCTeX and preview-latex (parsers are still
     separate).

   * Bug fix in XyMTeX support.

   * The LaTeX tool bar is now enabled by default.  *Note Processing
     Facilities::.

News in 11.82
=============

   * Support for the MinionPro LaTeX package was added.

   * Warnings and underfull/overfull boxes are now being indicated in
     the echo area after a LaTeX run, if the respective debugging
     options are activated with 'TeX-toggle-debug-warnings' ('C-c C-t
     C-w') or 'TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' ('C-c C-t C-b').  In this
     case 'TeX-next-error' will find these warnings in addition to
     normal errors.

     The key binding 'C-c C-w' for 'TeX-toggle-debug-bad-boxes' (which
     was renamed from 'TeX-toggle-debug-boxes') now is deprecated.

   * AUCTeX now can automatically insert a pair of braces after typing
     <_> or <^> in math constructs if the new variable
     'TeX-electric-sub-and-superscript' is set to a non-nil value.

   * Some language-specific support for French was added.  There now is
     completion support for the commands provided by the 'frenchb' (and
     'francais') options of the babel LaTeX package and easier input of
     French quotation marks ('\\og ...\\fg') which can now be inserted
     by typing <">.

   * Completion support for options of some LaTeX packages was added.

   * Already in version 11.81 the way to activate AUCTeX changed
     substantially.  This should now be done with '(load "auctex.el" nil
     t t)' instead of the former '(require 'tex-site)'.  Related to this
     change 'tex-mik.el' does not load 'tex-site.el' anymore.  That
     means if you used only '(require 'tex-mik)' in order to activate
     AUCTeX, you have to add '(load "auctex.el" nil t t)' before the
     latter statement.  *Note Loading the package::.

   * Handling of verbatim constructs was consolidated across AUCTeX.
     This resulted in the font-latex-specific variables
     'font-latex-verb-like-commands', 'font-latex-verbatim-macros', and
     'font-latex-verbatim-environments' being removed and the more
     general variables 'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims',
     'LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces', and
     'LaTeX-verbatim-environments' being added.

   * The output of a BibTeX run is now checked for warnings and errors,
     which are reported in the echo area.

   * The aliases for 'font-latex-title-fontify' were removed.  Use
     'font-latex-fontify-sectioning' instead.

   * The problem that Japanese macros where broken across lines was
     fixed.

   * Various bug fixes.

News in 11.81
=============

   * 'LaTeX-mark-section' now marks subsections of a given section as
     well.  The former behavior is available via the prefix argument.

   * preview-latex which was previously available separately became a
     subsystem of AUCTeX.  There is no documented provision for building
     or installing preview-latex separately.  It is still possible to
     use and install AUCTeX without preview-latex, however.

   * The installation procedures have been overhauled and now also
     install startup files as part of the process (those had to be
     copied manually previously).  You are advised to remove previous
     installations of AUCTeX and preview-latex before starting the
     installation procedure.  A standard installation from an unmodified
     tarball no longer requires Makeinfo or Perl.

     Also note that the way AUCTeX is supposed to be activated changed.
     Instead of '(require 'tex-site)' you should now use '(load
     "auctex.el" nil t t)'.  While the former method may still work, the
     new method has the advantage that you can deactivate a preactivated
     AUCTeX with the statement '(unload-feature 'tex-site)' before any
     of its modes have been used.  This may be important especially for
     site-wide installations.

   * Support for the babel LaTeX package was added.

   * Folding a buffer now ensures that the whole buffer is fontified
     before the actual folding is carried out.  If this results in
     unbearably long execution times, you can fall back to the old
     behavior of relying on stealth font locking to do this job in the
     background by customizing the variable 'TeX-fold-force-fontify'.

   * Folded content now reveals part of its original text in a tooltip
     or the echo area when hovering with the mouse pointer over it.

   * The language-specific insertion of quotation marks was generalized.
     The variables 'LaTeX-german-open-quote',
     'LaTeX-german-close-quote', 'LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote',
     'LaTeX-italian-open-quote', 'LaTeX-italian-close-quote', and
     'LaTeX-italian-quote-after-quote' are now obsolete.  If you are not
     satisfied with the default settings, you should customize
     'TeX-quote-language-alist' instead.

   * Similar to language-specific quote insertion, AUCTeX now helps you
     with hyphens in different languages as well.  *Note European::, for
     details.

   * Fill problems in Japanese text introduced in AUCTeX 11.55 were
     fixed.  AUCTeX tries not to break lines between 1-byte and 2-byte
     chars.  These features will work in Chinese text, too.

   * The scaling factor of the fontification of sectioning commands can
     now be customized using the variable
     'font-latex-fontify-sectioning'.  This variable was previously
     called 'font-latex-title-fontify'; In this release we provide an
     alias but this will disappear in one of the the next releases.  The
     faces for the sectioning commands are now called
     'font-latex-sectioning-N-face' (N=0...5) instead of
     'font-latex-title-N-face' (N=1...4).  Analogously the names of the
     variables holding the related keyword lists were changed from
     'font-latex-title-N-keywords' to
     'font-latex-sectioning-N-keywords'.  *Note Font Locking::, for
     details.  Make sure to adjust your customizations.

   * Titles in beamer slides marked by the "\frametitle" command are
     know displayed with the new face 'font-latex-slide-title-face'.
     You can add macros to be highlighted with this face to
     'font-latex-match-slide-title-keywords'.

   * Of course a lot of bugs have been fixed.

News in 11.55
=============

   * A bug was fixed which lead to the insertion of trailing whitespace
     during filling.  In particular extra spaces were added to sentence
     endings at the end of lines.  You can make this whitespace visible
     by setting the variable 'show-trailing-whitespace' to 't'.  If you
     want to delete all trailing whitespace in a buffer, type 'M-x
     delete-trailing-whitespace RET'.

   * A bug was fixed which lead to a '*Compile-Log*' buffer popping up
     when the first LaTeX file was loaded in an Emacs session.

   * On some systems the presence of an outdated Emacspeak package lead
     to the error message 'File mode specification error: (error
     "Variable binding depth exceeds max-specpdl-size")'.  Precautions
     were added which prevent this error from happening.  But
     nevertheless, it is advised to upgrade or uninstall the outdated
     Emacspeak package.

   * The value of 'TeX-macro-global' is not determined during
     configuration anymore but at load time of AUCTeX.  Consequently the
     associated configuration option '--with-tex-input-dirs' was
     removed.

   * Support for the LaTeX Japanese classes 'jsarticle' and 'jsbook' was
     added.

News in 11.54
=============

   * The parser (used e.g.  for 'TeX-auto-generate-global') was extended
     to recognize keywords common in LaTeX packages and classes, like
     "\DeclareRobustCommand" or "\RequirePackage".  Additionally a bug
     was fixed which led to duplicate entries in AUCTeX style files.

   * Folding can now be done for paragraphs and regions besides single
     constructs and the whole buffer.  With the new 'TeX-fold-dwim'
     command content can both be hidden and shown with a single key
     binding.  In course of these changes new key bindings for unfolding
     commands where introduced.  The old bindings are still present but
     will be phased out in future releases.

   * Info files of the manual now have a .info extension.

   * There is an experimental tool bar support now.  It is not activated
     by default.  If you want to use it, add
          (add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook 'LaTeX-install-toolbar)
     to your init file.

   * The manual now contains a new chapter "Quick Start".  It explains
     the main features and how to use them, and should be enough for a
     new user to start using AUCTeX.

   * A new section "Font Locking" was added to the manual which explains
     syntax highlighting in AUCTeX and its customization.  Together with
     the sections related to folding and outlining, the section is part
     of the new chapter "Display".

   * Keywords for syntax highlighting of LaTeX constructs to be typeset
     in bold, italic or typewriter fonts may now be customized.  Besides
     the built-in classes, new keyword classes may be added by
     customizing the variable 'font-latex-user-keyword-classes'.  The
     customization options can be found in the customization group
     'font-latex-keywords'.

   * Verbatim content is now displayed with the 'fixed-pitch' face.
     (GNU Emacs only)

   * Syntax highlighting should not spill out of verbatim content
     anymore.  (GNU Emacs only)

   * Verbatim commands like '\verb|...|' will not be broken anymore
     during filling.

   * You can customize the completion for graphic files with
     'LaTeX-includegraphics-read-file'.

   * Support for the LaTeX packages 'url', 'listings', 'jurabib' and
     'csquotes' was added with regard to command completion and syntax
     highlighting.

   * Performance of fontification and filling was improved.

   * Insertion of nodes in Texinfo mode now supports completion of
     existing node names.

   * Setting the variable 'LaTeX-float' to 'nil' now means that you will
     not be prompted for the float position of figures and tables.  You
     can get the old behaviour of 'nil' by setting the variable to '""',
     i.e.  an empty string.  See also *note Floats::.

   * The XEmacs-specific bug concerning 'overlays-at' was fixed.

   * Lots of bug fixes.

News in 11.53
=============

   * The LaTeX math menu can include Unicode characters if your Emacs
     built supports it.  See the variable 'LaTeX-math-menu-unicode',
     *note Mathematics::.

   * Bug fixes for XEmacs.

   * Completion for graphic files in the TeX search path has been added.

   * 'start' is used for the viewer for MiKTeX and fpTeX.

   * The variable 'TeX-fold-preserve-comments' can now be customized to
     deactivate folding in comments.

News in 11.52
=============

   * Installation and menus under XEmacs work again (maybe for the first
     time).

   * Fontification of subscripts and superscripts is now disabled when
     the fontification engine is not able to support it properly.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

News in 11.51
=============

   * PDFTeX and Source Special support did not work with ConTeXt, this
     has been fixed.  Similar for Source Special support under Windows.

   * Omega support has been added.

   * Bug fixes in the build process.

   * 'TeX-fold' now supports folding of environments in Texinfo mode.

News in 11.50
=============

   * The use of source specials when processing or viewing the document
     can now be controlled with the new 'TeX-source-specials' minor mode
     which can be toggled via an entry in the Command menu or the key
     binding 'C-c C-t C-s'.  If you have customized the variable
     'TeX-command-list', you have to re-initialize it for this to work.
     This means to open a customization buffer for the variable by
     typing 'M-x customize-variable RET TeX-command-list RET', selecting
     "Erase Customization" and do your customization again with the new
     default.

   * The content of the command menu now depends on the mode (plain TeX,
     LaTeX, ConTeXt etc.).  Any former customization of the variable
     'TeX-command-list' has to be erased.  Otherwise the command menu
     and the customization will not work correctly.

   * Support for hiding and auto-revealing macros, e.g.  footnotes or
     citations, and environments in a buffer was added, *note Folding::.

   * You can now control if indentation is done upon typing <RET> by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-newline-function', *note Indenting::.

   * Limited support for 'doc.sty' and 'ltxdoc.cls' ('dtx' files) was
     added.  The new docTeX mode provides functionality for editing
     documentation parts.  This includes formatting (indenting and
     filling), adding and completion of macros and environments while
     staying in comments as well as syntax highlighting.  (Please note
     that the mode is not finished yet.  For example syntax highlighting
     does not work yet in XEmacs.)

   * For macro completion in docTeX mode the AUCTeX style files
     'doc.el', 'ltxdoc.el' and 'ltx-base.el' were included.  The latter
     provides general support for low-level LaTeX macros and may be used
     with LaTeX class and style files as well.  It is currently not
     loaded automatically for those files.

   * Support for ConTeXt with a separate ConTeXt mode is now included.
     Macro definitions for completion are available in Dutch and
     English.

   * The filling and indentation code was overhauled and is now able to
     format commented parts of the source syntactically correct.  Newly
     available functionality and customization options are explained in
     the manual.

   * Filling and indentation in XEmacs with preview-latex and activated
     previews lead to the insertion of whitespace before multi-line
     previews.  AUCTeX now contains facilities to prevent this problem.

   * If 'TeX-master' is set to 't', AUCTeX will now query for a master
     file only when a new file is opened.  Existing files will be left
     alone.  The new function 'TeX-master-file-ask' (bound to 'C-c _' is
     provided for adding the variable manually.

   * Sectioning commands are now shown in a larger font on display
     devices which support such fontification.  The variable
     'font-latex-title-fontify' can be customized to restore the old
     appearance, i.e.  the usage of a different color instead of a
     change in size.

   * Support for 'alphanum.sty', 'beamer.cls', 'booktabs.sty',
     'captcont.sty', 'emp.sty', 'paralist.sty', 'subfigure.sty' and
     'units.sty'/'nicefrac.sty' was added.  Credits go to the authors
     mentioned in the respective AUCTeX style files.

   * Inserting graphics with 'C-c RET \includegraphics RET' was
     improved.  See the variable 'LaTeX-includegraphics-options-alist'.

   * If 'LaTeX-default-position' is 'nil', don't prompt for position
     arguments in Tabular-like environments, see *note Tabular-like::.

   * Completion for available packages when using 'C-c RET \usepackage
     RET' was improved on systems using the kpathsea library.

   * The commenting functionality was fixed.  The separate functions for
     commenting and uncommenting were unified in one function for
     paragraphs and regions respectively which do both.

   * Syntax highlighting can be customized to fontify quotes delimited
     by either >>German<< or <<French>> quotation marks by changing the
     variable 'font-latex-quotes'.

   * Certain TeX/LaTeX keywords for functions, references, variables and
     warnings will now be fontified specially.  You may add your own
     keywords by customizing the variables
     'font-latex-match-function-keywords',
     'font-latex-match-reference-keywords',
     'font-latex-match-variable-keywords' and
     'font-latex-match-warning-keywords'.

   * If you include the style files 'german' or 'ngerman' in a document
     (directly or via the 'babel' package), you should now customize
     'LaTeX-german-open-quote', 'LaTeX-german-close-quote' and
     'LaTeX-german-quote-after-quote' instead of 'TeX-open-quote',
     'TeX-close-quote' and 'TeX-quote-after-quote' if you want to
     influence the type of quote insertion.

   * Upon viewing an output file, the right viewer and command line
     options for it are now determined automatically by looking at the
     extension of the output file and certain options used in the source
     file.  The behavior can be adapted or extended respectively by
     customizing the variable 'TeX-output-view-style'.

   * You can control whether 'TeX-insert-macro' ('C-c RET') ask for all
     optional arguments by customizing the variable
     'TeX-insert-macro-default-style', *note Completion::.

   * 'TeX-run-discard' is now able to completely detach a process that
     it started.

   * The build process was enhanced and is now based on 'autoconf'
     making installing AUCTeX a mostly automatic process.  See *note
     Installation:: and *note Installation under MS Windows:: for
     details.

A.3 Future Development
======================

The following sections describe future development of AUCTeX.  Besides
mid-term goals, bug reports and requests we cannot fix or honor right
away are being gathered here.  If you have some time for Emacs Lisp
hacking, you are encouraged to try to provide a solution to one of the
following problems.  If you don't know Lisp, you may help us to improve
the documentation.  It might be a good idea to discuss proposed changes
on the mailing list of AUCTeX first.

* Mid-term Goals::
* Wishlist::
* Bugs::


File: auctex.info,  Node: Mid-term Goals,  Next: Wishlist,  Up: Development

A.3.1 Mid-term Goals
--------------------

   * Integration of preview-latex into AUCTeX

     As of AUCTeX 11.81 preview-latex is a part of AUCTeX in the sense
     that the installation routines were merged and preview-latex is
     being packaged with AUCTeX.

     Further integration will happen at the backend.  This involves
     folding of error parsing and task management of both packages which
     will ease development efforts and avoid redundant work.

   * Error help catalogs

     Currently, the help for errors is more or less hardwired into
     'tex.el'.  For supporting error help in other languages, it would
     be sensible to instead arrange error messages in language-specific
     files, make a common info file from all such catalogs in a given
     language and look the error texts up in an appropriate index.  The
     user would then specify a preference list of languages, and the
     errors would be looked up in the catalogs in sequence until they
     were identified.

   * Combining 'docTeX' with RefTeX

     Macro cross references should also be usable for document
     navigation using RefTeX.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Wishlist,  Next: Bugs,  Prev: Mid-term Goals,  Up: Development

A.3.2 Wishlist
--------------

   * Documentation lookup for macros

     A parser could gather information about which macros are defined in
     which LaTeX packages and store the information in a hashtable which
     can be used in a backend for 'TeX-doc' in order to open the
     matching documentation for a given macro.  The information could
     also be used to insert an appropriate '\usepackage' statement if
     the user tries to insert a macro for which the respective package
     has not been requested yet.

   * Spell checking of macros

     A special ispell dictionary for macros could be nice to have.

   * Improvements to error reporting

     Fringe indicators for errors in the main text would be nice.

   * A math entry grid

     A separate frame with a table of math character graphics to click
     on in order to insert the respective sequence into the buffer (cf.
     the "grid" of x-symbol).

   * Crossreferencing support

     It would be nice if you could index process your favorite
     collection of '.dtx' files (such as the LaTeX source), just call a
     command on arbitrary control sequence, and get either the DVI
     viewer opened right at the definition of that macro (using Source
     Specials), or the source code of the '.dtx' file.

   * Better plain TeX support

     For starters, 'LaTeX-math-mode' is not very LaTeX-specific in the
     first place, and similar holds for indentation and formatting.

   * Page count when compiling should (optionally) go to modeline of the
     window where the compilation command was invoked, instead of the
     output window.  Suggested by Karsten Tinnefeld
     <tinnefeld@irb.informatik.uni-dortmund.de>.

   * Command to insert a macrodefinition in the preamble, without moving
     point from the current location.  Suggested by "Jeffrey C. Ely"
     <ely@nwu.edu>.

   * A database of all commands defined in all stylefiles.  When a
     command or environment gets entered that is provided in one of the
     styles, insert the appropriate '\usepackage' in the preamble.

   * A way to add and overwrite math mode entries in style files, and to
     decide where they should be.  Suggested by Remo Badii
     <Remo.Badii@psi.ch>.

   * Create template for (first) line of tabular environment.

   * I think prompting for the master is the intended behaviour.  It
     corresponds to a 'shared' value for TeX-master.

     There should probably be a 'none' value which wouldn't query for
     the master, but instead disable all features that relies on
     TeX-master.

     This default value for TeX-master could then be controled with
     mapping based on the extension.

   * Suggest 'makeindex' when appropriate.

   * Use index files (when available) to speed up 'C-c C-m include
     <RET>'.

   * Option not to calculate very slow completions like for 'C-c C-m
     include <RET>'.

   * Font menu should be created from 'TeX-font-list'.

   * Installation procedure written purely in emacs lisp.

   * Included PostScript files should also be counted as part of the
     document.

   * A nice hierarchical by-topic organization of all officially
     documented LaTeX macros, available from the menu bar.

   * 'TeX-command-default' should be set from the master file, if not
     set locally.  Suggested by Peter Whaite '<peta@cim.mcgill.ca>'.

   * Make AUCTeX work with 'crypt++'.  Suggested by Chris Moore
     '<Chris.Moore@src.bae.co.uk>'.

   * Make AUCTeX work with 'longlines'.  This would also apply to
     preview-latex, though it might make sense to unify error processing
     before attempting this.

   * The 'Spell' command should apply to all files in a document.  Maybe
     it could try to restrict to files that have been modified since
     last spell check?  Suggested by Ravinder Bhumbla
     '<rbhumbla@ucsd.edu>'.

   * Make <.> check for abbreviations and sentences ending with capital
     letters.

   * Use Emacs 19 minibuffer history to choose between previewers, and
     other stuff.  Suggested by John Interrante
     '<interran@uluru.Stanford.EDU>'.

   * Make features.

     A new command 'TeX-update' ('C-c C-u') could be used to create an
     up-to-date dvi file by repeatedly running BibTeX, MakeIndex and
     (La)TeX, until an error occurs or we are done.

     An alternative is to have an 'Update' command that ensures the
     'dvi' file is up to date.  This could be called before printing and
     previewing.

   * Documentation of variables that can be set in a style hook.

     We need a list of what can safely be done in an ordinary style
     hook.  You can not set a variable that AUCTeX depends on, unless
     AUCTeX knows that it has to run the style hooks first.

     Here is the start of such a list.

     'LaTeX-add-environments'

     'TeX-add-symbols'

     'LaTeX-add-labels'

     'LaTeX-add-bibliographies'

     'LaTeX-largest-level'

   * Outline should be (better) supported in TeX mode.

     At least, support headers, trailers, as well as TeX-outline-extra.

   * 'TeX-header-start' and 'TeX-trailer-end'.

     We might want these, just for fun (and outlines)

   * Plain TeX and LaTeX specific header and trailer expressions.

     We should have a way to globally specify the default value of the
     header and trailer regexps.

   * Get closer to original 'TeX-mode' keybindings.

     A third initialization file ('tex-mode.el') containing an emulator
     of the standard 'TeX-mode' would help convince some people to
     change to AUCTeX.

   * Use markers in 'TeX-error-list' to remember buffer positions in
     order to be more robust with regard to line numbers and changed
     files.

   * Finish the Texinfo mode.  For one thing, many Texinfo mode commands
     do not accept braces around their arguments.

   * Hook up the letter environment with 'bbdb.el'.


File: auctex.info,  Node: Bugs,  Prev: Wishlist,  Up: Development

A.3.3 Bugs
----------

   * The style hooks automatically generated by parsing files for
     'example.dtx', 'example.sty', 'example.drv' and 'example.bib' all
     clash.  Bad.  Clash with hand-written style hooks should be removed
     by dialect discrimination -- to be checked.

   * 'C-c `' should always stay in the current window, also when it
     finds a new file.

   * Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when
     loading a new file.

   * Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be
     '"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"' --
     '<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>' Peter Thiemann.

   * AUCTeX should not parse verbatim environments.

   * Make '`' check for math context in 'LaTeX-math-mode'.  and simply
     self insert if not in a math context.

   * Make 'TeX-insert-dollar' more robust.  Currently it can be fooled
     by '\mbox''es and escaped double dollar for example.

   * Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array
     environments.

   * No syntactic font locking of verbatim macros and environments.
     (XEmacs only)

   * Font locking inside of verbatim macros and environments is not
     inhibited.  This may result in syntax highlighting of unbalanced
     dollar signs and the like spilling out of the verbatim content.
     (XEmacs only)

   * Folding of LaTeX constructs spanning more than one line may result
     in overfull lines.  (XEmacs only)

A.4 Frequently Asked Questions
==============================

  1. Something is not working correctly.  What should I do?

     Well, you might have guessed it, the first place to look is in the
     available documentation packaged with AUCTeX.  This could be the
     release notes (in the 'RELEASE' file) or the news section of the
     manual in case you are experiencing problems after an upgrade, the
     'INSTALL' file in case you are having problems with the
     installation, the section about bugs in the manual in case you
     encountered a bug or the relevant sections in the manual for other
     related problems.

     If this did not help, you can send a bug report to the AUCTeX bug
     reporting list by using the command 'M-x TeX-submit-bug-report
     RET'.  But before you do this, you can try to get more information
     about the problem at hand which might also help you locate the
     cause of the error yourself.

     First, you can try to generate a so-called backtrace which shows
     the functions involved in a program error.  In order to do this,
     start Emacs with the command line 'emacs --debug-init' and/or put
     the line

          (setq debug-on-error t)

     as the first line into your init file.  XEmacs users might want to
     add '(setq stack-trace-on-error t)' as well.  After Emacs has
     started, you can load a file which triggers the error and a new
     window should pop up showing the backtrace.  If you get such a
     backtrace, please include it in the bug report.

     Second, you can try to figure out if something in your personal or
     site configuration triggers the error by starting Emacs without
     such customizations.  You can do this by invoking Emacs with the
     command line 'emacs -q -no-site-file -l auctex'.  The '-l' option
     'auctex.el' which you normally do in your init file.  After you
     have started Emacs like this, you can load the file triggering the
     error.  If everything is working now, you know that you have to
     search either in the site configuration file or your personal init
     file for statements related to the problem.

  2. What versions of Emacs and XEmacs are supported?

     AUCTeX was tested with Emacs 21 and XEmacs 21.4.15.  Older versions
     may work but are unsupported.  Older versions of XEmacs might
     possibly made to work by updating the 'xemacs-base' package through
     the XEmacs package system.  If you are looking for a
     recommendation, it would appear that the smoothest working platform
     on all operating systems at the current point of time would be Emacs 22
     or higher.

     Our success with XEmacs has been less than convincing.  Code for
     core functionality like formatting and syntax highlighting tends to
     be different and often older than even Emacs 21.4, and Unicode
     support as delivered is problematic at best, missing on Windows.
     Both AUCTeX and XEmacs developers don't hear much from active users
     of the combination.  Partly for that reason, problems tend to go
     unnoticed for long amounts of time and are often found, if at all,
     after releases.  No experiences or recommendations can be given for
     beta or developer versions of XEmacs.

  3. What should I do when './configure' does not find programs like
     latex?

     This is problem often encountered on Windows.  Make sure that the
     'PATH' environment variable includes the directories containing the
     relevant programs, as described in *note (auctex)Installation under
     MS Windows::.

  4. Why doesn't the completion, style file, or multi-file stuff work?

     It must be enabled first, insert this in your init file:

          (setq-default TeX-master nil)
          (setq TeX-parse-self t)
          (setq TeX-auto-save t)

     Read also the chapters about parsing and multifile documents in the
     manual.

  5. Why doesn't 'TeX-save-document' work?

     'TeX-check-path' has to contain "./" somewhere.

  6. Why is the information in 'foo.tex' forgotten when I save
     'foo.bib'?

     For various reasons, AUCTeX ignores the extension when it stores
     information about a file, so you should use unique base names for
     your files.  E.g.  rename 'foo.bib' to 'foob.bib'.

  7. Why doesn't AUCTeX signal when processing a document is done?

     If the message in the minibuffer stays "Type 'C-c C-l' to display
     results of compilation.", you probably have a misconfiguration in
     your init file ('.emacs', 'init.el' or similar).  To track this
     down either search in the '*Messages*' buffer for an error message
     or put '(setq debug-on-error t)' as the first line into your init
     file, restart Emacs and open a LaTeX file.  Emacs will complain
     loudly by opening a debugging buffer as soon as an error occurs.
     The information in the debugging buffer can help you find the cause
     of the error in your init file.

  8. Why does 'TeX-next-error' ('C-c `') fail?

     When writing the log file, TeX puts information related to a file,
     including error messages, between a pair of parentheses.  AUCTeX
     determines the file where the error happened by parsing the log
     file and counting the parentheses.  This can fail when there are
     other, unbalanced parentheses present.

     As a workaround you can activate so-called file:line:error messages
     for the log file.  (Those are are easier to parse, but may lack
     some details.)  Either you do this in the configuration of your TeX
     system (consult its manual to see where this is) or you add a
     command line switch to the (la)tex call, e.g.  by customizing
     'LaTeX-command-style' or 'TeX-command-list'.

  9. What does AUC stand for?

     AUCTeX came into being at Aalborg University in Denmark.  Back then
     the Danish name of the university was Aalborg Universitetscenter;
     AUC for short.

A.5 Features specific to AUCTeX's Texinfo major mode
====================================================

AUCTeX includes a major mode for editting Texinfo files.  This major
mode is not the same mode as the native Texinfo mode (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode::) of Emacs, although they have the same name.  However,
AUCTeX still relies on a number of functions from the native Texinfo
mode.

   The following text describes which functionality is offered by AUCTeX
and which by the native Texinfo mode.  This should enable you to decide
when to consult the AUCTeX manual and when the manual of the native
mode.  And in case you are a seasoned user of the native mode, the
information should help you to swiftly get to know the AUCTeX-specific
commands.

A.5.1 How AUCTeX and the native mode work together
--------------------------------------------------

In a nutshell the split between AUCTeX Texinfo mode, and native Texinfo
mode is as follows:

   * Most of the editing (environment creation, commenting, font command
     insertions) and/or processing commands (e.g.  compiling or
     printing) which are available in other AUCTeX modes are also
     handled by AUCTeX in Texinfo mode.

   * Texinfo-related features (e.g.  info node linkage or menu creation)
     rely on the commands provided by the native Texinfo mode.  AUCTeX
     provides the key bindings to reach these functions, keeping the
     same keys as in native Texinfo whenever possible, or similar ones
     otherwise.

A.5.2 Where the native mode is superseded
-----------------------------------------

This section is directed to users of the native Texinfo mode switching
to AUCTeX.  It follows the summary of the native mode (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode Summary::) and lists which of its commands are no longer of
use.

Insert commands
     In the native Texinfo mode, frequently used Texinfo commands can be
     inserted with key bindings of the form 'C-c C-c K' where K differs
     for each Texinfo command; 'c' inserts @code, 'd' inserts @dfn, 'k'
     @kbd, etc.

     In AUCTeX commands are inserted with the key binding 'C-c C-m'
     instead which prompts for the macro to be inserted.  For font
     selection commands (like @b, @i, or @emph) and a few related ones
     (like @var, @key or @code) there are bindings which insert the
     respective macros directly.  They have the form 'C-c C-f K' or 'C-c
     C-f C-K' and call the function 'TeX-font'.  Type 'C-c C-f <RET>' to
     get a list of supported commands.

     Note that the prefix argument is not handled the same way by
     AUCTeX.  Note also that the node insertion command from the native
     mode ('texinfo-insert-@node') can still accessed from the Texinfo
     menu in AUCTeX.

Insert braces
     In AUCTeX braces can be inserted with the same key binding as in
     the native Texinfo mode: 'C-c {'.  But AUCTeX uses its own function
     for the feature: 'TeX-insert-braces'.

Insert environments
     The native Texinfo mode does not insert full environments.
     Instead, it provides the function 'texinfo-insert-@end' (mapped to
     'C-c C-c e') for closing an open environment with a matching @end
     statement.

     In AUCTeX you can insert full environments, i.e.  both the opening
     and closing statements, with the function 'Texinfo-environment'
     (mapped to 'C-c C-e').

Format info files with makeinfo and TeX
     In the native Texinfo mode there are various functions and bindings
     to format a region or the whole buffer for info or to typeset the
     respective text.  For example, there is 'makeinfo-buffer' (mapped
     to 'C-c C-m C-b') which runs 'makeinfo' on the buffer or there is
     'texinfo-tex-buffer' (mapped to 'C-c C-t C-b') which runs TeX on
     the buffer in order to produce a DVI file.

     In AUCTeX different commands for formatting or typesetting can be
     invoked through the function 'TeX-command-master' (mapped to 'C-c
     C-c').  After typing 'C-c C-c', you can select the desired command,
     e.g 'Makeinfo' or 'TeX', through a prompt in the mini buffer.  Note
     that you can make, say 'Makeinfo', the default by adding this
     statement in your init file:

          (add-hook 'Texinfo-mode-hook
                    (lambda () (setq TeX-command-default "Makeinfo")))

     Note also that 'C-c C-c Makeinfo <RET>' is not completely
     functionally equivalent to 'makeinfo-buffer' as the latter will
     display the resulting info file in Emacs, showing the node
     corresponding to the position in the source file, just after a
     successful compilation.  This is why, while using AUCTeX, invoking
     'makeinfo-buffer' might still be more convenient.

     Note also that in the case of a multifile document, 'C-c C-c' in
     AUCTeX will work on the whole document (provided that the file
     variable 'TeX-master' is set correctly), while 'makeinfo-buffer' in
     the native mode will process only the current buffer, provided at
     the '@setfilename' statement is provided.

Produce indexes and print
     The native Texinfo mode provides the binding 'C-c C-t C-i'
     ('texinfo-texindex') for producing an index and the bindings 'C-c
     C-t C-p' ('texinfo-tex-print') and 'C-c C-t C-q'
     ('tex-show-print-queue') for printing and showing the printer
     queue.  These are superseded by the respective commands available
     through 'C-c C-c' ('TeX-command-master') in AUCTeX: Index, Print,
     and Queue.

Kill jobs
     The command 'C-c C-t C-k' ('tex-kill-job') in the native mode is
     superseded by 'C-c C-k' ('TeX-kill-job') in AUCTeX.

A.5.3 Where key bindings are mapped to the native mode
------------------------------------------------------

This node follows the native Texinfo mode summary (*note (texinfo)
Texinfo Mode Summary::) and lists only those commands to which AUCTeX
provides a keybinding.

   Basically all commands of the native mode related to producing menus
and interlinking nodes are mapped to same or similar keys in AUCTeX,
while a few insertion commands are mapped to AUCTeX-like keys.

'@item' insertion
     The binding 'C-c C-c i' for the insertion of '@item' in the native
     mode is mapped to 'M-<RET>' or 'C-c C-j' in AUCTeX, similar to
     other AUCTeX modes.

'@end' insertion
     The binding 'C-c C-c e' for closing a '@FOO' command by a
     corresponding '@end FOO' statement in the native mode is mapped to
     'C-c C-]' in AUCTeX, similar to other AUCTeX modes.

Move out of balanced braces
     The binding 'C-}' ('up-list') is available both in the native mode
     and in AUCTeX.  (This is because the command is not implemented in
     either mode but a native Emacs command.)  However, in AUCTeX, you
     cannot use 'C-]' for this, as it is used for '@end' insertion.

Update pointers
     The bindings 'C-c C-u C-n' ('texinfo-update-node') and 'C-c C-u
     C-e' ('texinfo-every-node-update') from the native mode are
     available in AUCTeX as well.

Update menus
     The bindings 'C-c C-u m' ('texinfo-master-menu'), 'C-c C-u C-m'
     ('texinfo-make-menu'), and 'C-c C-u C-a'
     ('texinfo-all-menus-update') from the native mode are available in
     AUCTeX as well.  The command 'texinfo-start-menu-description',
     bound to 'C-c C-c C-d' in the native mode, is bound to 'C-c C-u
     C-d' in AUCTeX instead.

A.5.4 Which native mode key bindings are missing
------------------------------------------------

The following commands from the native commands might still be useful
when working with AUCTeX, however, they are not accessible with a key
binding any longer.

'@node' insertion
     The node insertion command, mapped to 'C-c C-c n' in the native
     mode, is not mapped to any key in AUCTeX.  You can still access it
     through the Texinfo menu, though.  Another alternative is to use
     the 'C-c C-m' binding for macro insertion in AUCTeX.

Show the section structure
     The command 'texinfo-show-structure' ('C-c C-s') from the native
     mode does not have a key binding in AUCTeX.  The binding is used by
     AUCTeX for sectioning.
